The dream is always the same.
Instead of going home, I go to the neighbors'.
I ring, but nobody answers.
The door is open, so I go inside.
I look around, but no one seems to be there.
Then I hear the shower running.
So, I go upstairs to see what's what.
Then I see her.
This... girl!
This incredible girl!
I don't know why she's there because she doesn't live there... ...but it's a dream, so I go with it.
"Who's there?" she says.
"Joel," I say.
"What are you doing here?"
"I don't know.
"What are you doing here?"
"I'm taking a shower," she says.
Then I give her... ..."Do you want me to go?"
"No," she says. "I want you to wash my back."
I'm getting enthusiastic about this dream.
So, I go to her, but she's hard to find through all the steam.
I keep losing her.
Finally, I get to the door...
...and I find myself in a room full of kids taking their College Boards.
I'm over three hours late!
I've got two minutes to take the whole test.
I've just made a terrible mistake.
I'll never get to college.
My life is ruined.
Here's the game:
Five-card draw with a spit. Anaconda, high-low.
Pass two to the right, one to the left...
What happened?
Last night?
That's right, with Kessler.
She was babysitting down the street.
We know that! So, I went over there.
She was giving the kid a bath and accidentally hit the shower thing.
All of her clothes were drying upstairs.
So, she plops down on the kitchen floor... ...she looks up at me and says... ..."I think I'm in the mood."
She said that?
What did you say?
I didn't have to say anything.
What do you think I did?
I think you got the hell out of there, ran home and whacked off!
I disagree.
Did you have your bike there?
I think you jumped on your bike, pedaled home and whacked off!
That's what you think, right?
With Kessler sitting on the floor like that, wanting me?
No guts, Goodson.
The problem was I just wasn't attracted to her.
That should never stop you.
She seemed too big. It could've worked out.
I thought I'd get into trouble.
Sometimes you have to say, "What the fuck!" Make your move!
That's easy for you to say.
You're all set. You're probably going to Harvard.
Me, I don't want to make a mistake, jeopardize my future!
Joel, let me tell you something.
Every now and then, say, "What the fuck."
"What the fuck," gives you freedom.
Freedom brings opportunity.
Opportunity makes your future.
Be right there.
So, your folks are going out of town?
Tomorrow.
You've got the place all to yourself?
Yeah?
"What the fuck."
If you can't say it... ...you can't do it.
Joel, did you get your SAT scores?
How did you do?
597 Math, 560 Verbal.
If you wanted to, you could take them again?
- I guess so. - Great. Joel, I want to show you something.
Honey, did you pack my Mace?
Yes, in your cosmetic case.
Joel, do you hear something odd?
Something unpleasant? No.
A preponderance of bass, perhaps?
No.
Is this the way I left the equalizer?
No.
This is not a toy for you and your friends.
If you can't use it properly, you're not to use it at all.
My house, my rules.
Joel, I spoke to Bill Rutherford.
He interviews for Princeton.
I'll never get into Princeton!
I already arranged an interview. Friday night, the 4th, at our house.
Jesus, Dad!
Tell him about your involvement with Future Enterprisers.
They like that.
There's $50 for food, which is more than enough... ...another $50 for emergencies and an extra $25 just in case.
Don't forget to water the plants on the patio.
I made a list, it's on the refrigerator door.
Dad, should I start your car?
The car will be fine, Joel.
For the battery, I mean. Please, you're not to use my car.
You're not insured for it. - Use the station wagon.
- Use my car, honey.
Do we understand each other?
Okay!
As far as the house is concerned, just use your best judgment.
We trust you. Have a great time.
Be good. We will, honey.
"Just take those old records off the shelf "I sit and listen to them by myself  "Today's music ain't got the same soul
Guess what?
Dalby got into Harvard.
He must have aced his Boards.
780 Verbal.
765 Math!
Shit!
Do you know what a Harvard MBA makes, first year? $40,000.
My cousin went into dermatology.
First year, over $60,000! Just for squeezing zits?
Why don't you try it, Barry? You have the experience.
Thank you, you're very kind.
Listen, you guys. Doesn't anyone want to accomplish anything?
Or do we just want to make money?
Make money. Just make money.
Make a lot of money.
What about you, Joel?
Serve my fellow mankind.
Profit motive.
Competition.
Free enterprise.
Is there any company that doesn't have a product in production?
We're falling far behind.
You haven't exactly been helping. You wanted to be the production executive.
Bullshit! Every sales manager I know helps with production.
Yeah?
Who? Everyone!
Just help me with the production! I can't!
I'm too busy with marketing and sales! How can you be busy with marketing and sales?  I haven't given you the product yet!
Barry, just bring the goddamn thing over tonight.
I only did this because I thought it'd look good on my record.
Hi, Glenn.
What's up? - I heard your parents were away.
- Yeah.
I thought maybe I could borrow a room?
Barry is here and we're working.
We won't bother you.
We don't have anywhere to go.
You know how it is.
Sure. Take my room.
Thanks, Joel.
Ready?
The "Memo-Minder"!
Here's how it works.
A call comes in for your mom, it's fairly important.
What do you do? You write the message down here, hit the switch... you've got the light.
Now, a call for your dad comes in and it's really important!
You're gonna get your ass kicked in if he misses it.
So, what do you do? Write the message down there, hit position two...
$1.86 in parts, sell it for $9.95 and make a fortune!
I can't concentrate with this.
This is really annoying.
It's ridiculous!
I'm out of here.
Lock the door when you leave, Glenn.
If you read me, grunt twice! Thank you!
I can't believe Glenn bringing Statwiler over like that.
Why? Because he boffed Hendricks last week!
He did?
Yes! And after the game on Saturday, he fucked her.
- Barry?
- What? Boffing and fucking are the same thing.
They are?
Yes.
What did you think it was? I thought it was something else.
You're sure on this?
I'm positive.
Shit!
Sublime breasts.
They're what kind of breasts? Sublime breasts!  A couple of boys in daddy's car.
Do you want to race?
Hit it.
Okay.
Good. You've done the old man's car bit. That's a good start.
Now, try this on for size.
"The Leather Castle.
"Chicago's finest dominants and submissives.
"Fully equipped dungeons. Beginners welcome."
It sounds great, Miles.
Here's one!
"My daddy used to spank my bare bottom.
"Now he's gone. Will you take his place?
"Call Misty."
Come on, Joel. You've got to take advantage of this!
They come to your house!
"Countess Angelique seeks young submissive with large ankles!"
This is it!
"For a good time in the privacy of your own home, call Jackie:
"555-4875."
Succinct, to the point, down to business. What do you say?
If you want to call, call for yourself.
A good time, Joel!
In the privacy of your own home!
What else can you ask for?
I'll make my own calls, thank you.
Then... ...call!
Forget it! Forget it!
All right!
I'm calling.
You're calling?
Someday you'll thank me for this.
You'd better not mention me.
It's her answering machine. Hi, Jackie, this is Joel Goodson, 345 Remson, Glencoe.
I'd like a good time in my home tonight. Bye!
That was really cute.
Now, give me the number so I can call her back.
There's no number?
Give me the number, damn it!
There's no number.
You're an asshole!
Gotta go. Catch you later.
Shithead! Oh, God!
Hello, Joel.
I'm Jackie. How are you?
Nice to meet you, Jackie.
I'm not Joel. Joel stepped out for a moment.
I'll go call him.
Holy shit!
Dalby, get your ass over here!
I'm playing cards, Joel!
Just get over here!
Is she there? Yes, she is here, and she is waiting for you!
She's not waiting for me, she's waiting for you.
Are you coming?
No! I'm playing cards!
You're not coming?
Get over here, Dalby!
Look, I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
Joel, be a courageous person.
Open the door! That way, you see, I can call a cab.
Again, I'm really sorry.
As long as we come to an arrangement, I'm in no mood for complaining.
I mean, when you put your good money down... ...you gotta get what you wanted in the first place.
Know what I mean? When you buy a TV, you don't buy Sony if you want RCA.
I know we could get along real well.
But, hey! It's your hard-earned money, right?
This way, we make an arrangement and everyone is satisfied.
You had carfare.
A long ride. I don't ever come out this far.
And your time.
My time, my effort, my infinite patience and understanding.
Thank you. $75.
Fair enough.
Joel, I'm going to give you a number.
You ask for Lana.
- It's what you want.
- Thank you.
It's what every white boy off the lake wants. All right, Goodson, we know you're in there!
What's that?
I think someone's out there. Joel, the house is surrounded.
Do exactly as we say, and no one gets hurt.
Oh, shit! Get off the babysitter!
Put on your pants, and come out with your hands up!
Please, Joel, do as they say!
Get off the babysitter!
Don't throw your life away like this.
Listen, you goddamn punk, you'll never have a future!
You got that? No future!
Who is that?
My father! Hello?
Lana?
Yes?
Hi.
I'm a nice guy, and I'd like to meet you tonight.
Fine. Where are you?
Where do you live?
Glencoe.
What's your name?
Ralph.
Ralph, can I have the address?
345... ...Remson.
Ralph?
I'll see you tonight. Are you ready for me, Ralph?
This is a beautiful place, Ralph. Is it all yours?
It's my folks', actually.
Do you know what it's worth?
A lot, probably.
Oh, yeah!
Real estate? It's fabulous!
Look, Lana... my name really isn't Ralph. It's Joel.
I need $300... Joel.
You're kidding?
No, I don't believe I am. Can I send it to you?
Can you send it to me, Joel?
I just don't have that much here in the house.
How much do you have?
- I have $50. - $50?
What are we going to do about this?
I have a bond at the bank I could cash... I'm not good at waiting for people.
I'll be quick.
Give it a try. I'm back!
I'm here for you.
How could she? It's so stupid!
Tell your mother it broke! That egg is worth a lot more than $300!
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna get it back, is what I'm gonna do.
Are you going to help? Sure. When?
Right now!
I can't do it right now! I have a trig.
Mid-term tomorrow! Hey, "Mr. What-The-Fuck"... ...what about "exploring the dark side" and all that?
Or was that just bullshit?
That was just bullshit, Joel.
I'm surprised you listened to me.
Are you coming?
How can you even tell if she'll be here?
I called Jackie and she said to try here.
Great idea. Where else could we get a hot chocolate for $4?
She's here!
Where?
The blue dress... those legs...
That's her.
She's fantastic!
She's looking right at us! She knows we're here.
That's it?
That's it, Joel?
I can't believe we came all the way here for that!
At least she knows we're on to her, Miles.
Yeah, she must be terrified.
Joel!
Is this your car?
Maybe.
Could we talk a minute?
Okay.
Let's talk!
Okay. In the car, all right? It's freezing.
Will you do me a favor?
You want me to do you a favor?
I just need a lift. Look, I want my egg back!
Get out of the car!
Joel, better get moving.
I want my egg back! You got it, all right? Just start driving!
When? - Now! - Open the door!
When do I get it back?
Start driving! Open the door!
Are you going to open the door?
Hey, buster! Fuck!
Will you just... - Get off the car!
- Just start driving! Start driving, now!
Why don't you start the car, Joel?
Fuck!
Get out of here! Start the goddamn car, Joel!
Lana, open the door.
Where are you going? Lana! Get out, or I'll kill you!
Who was that guy?
My manager. He gets a little crazy sometimes.
This is my friend, Miles.
Do you like excitement, Miles?
Okay, where do you want to go?
I don't know, Joel.
I haven't given it a lot of thought.
Tell me this: Am I going in the right direction?
Oh, shit!
Here he comes! Here who comes?
That manager guy?
Hey, Guido!
Big man, Guido!
Big man with a gun!
What are you going to do? Shoot us all? Stupid!
This guy Guido... ...he's a "manager"?
- That's right. Or a pimp?
Now, that's quick, Joel.
Have you always been this quick, or is this something new?
I don't believe this! I have a trig.
Mid-term tomorrow... ...and I'm being chased by Guido, The Killer Pimp!
Miles?
I think I can take him.
What are you talking... I'm really not enjoying this.
I think I'm going to throw up.
I think I'm going to throw up on you, Joel!
Porsche... ...there is no substitute.
Fuck you.
Hi, dear.
It's Mother.
How are you?
Just checking in to say hello, see how you're doing... ...and give you our flight information.
Wait a minute.
Let me write this down. Saturday, United, Flight 162 at 3:30.
That's right. How's everything else? Do you have enough money?
It never seems to go as far as you think it will.
Yes, I know.
I'm learning, Mom.
How is Aunt Tudi?
I will. See you then, bye.
Your folks?
So, how are they?
Oh, they're just great.
How about Aunt Tudi? Her hip is much better.
She sends her love.
You were telling me about Guido.
I quit Guido.
How come?
He thought he owned me.
Nobody owns me.
The problem is, I owe him for clothes and hospital bills.
You were in the hospital?
I had this... ...pain in my chest.
I thought it was a heart condition.
What was it?
The doctor said nerves. Nice service.
Reed & Barton.
Thank you for breakfast. It was good.
I'm going to school now.
I'll have to ask you to leave.
I'm sorry.
You won't let me stay?
No, I have to go to school.
I'm really sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.
You guys go ahead without me.
She's still here?
She won't leave. She won't leave.
Lana, look... ...I just want my egg back.
Did you have a good time last night?
You mean when we got back here?
I think you know what I mean.
I had a great time.
Don't tell me I owe you another $300.
Did I say you owe me anything?
No, you didn't. I don't remember saying you owe me anything.
What about my mother's egg?
You're the one who's going to college, you figure it out.
How much time do you need?
I need long enough to make a few phone calls.
I have to figure out how to get my stuff back.
Guido has probably locked me out of the apartment by now.
All right!
But will you do me a favor?
Anything, cookie.
Don't steal anything!
If I come back here, and find anything missing... ...I'm going straight to the police.
Joel, go to school. Go learn something.
May I see your pass, please!
I'm sure you've all read chapters six through eight... ...so here's a little pop quiz to confirm it.
Will you put your books on the floor, please?
You didn't tell anyone, did you? No. Glenn knows.
What about Barry?
He knows, too.
Don't tell anyone!
I won't! I won't!
Lab reports should be on my desk by tomorrow afternoon.
I won't accept any that aren't typed. Term papers are due on Friday.
They count for 50% of this semester's grades.
Damn it!
Hey, Miles, what's going on?
I'm waiting for Glenn.
Glenn?
Where is he? Inside.
In the house?
He wanted to meet her!
What are you doing?
I was inside. I can see that.
You're home now.
Yeah, I live here, remember?
Glenn?
Tell me you didn't do anything with her.
Who, Lana? Yeah, Lana.
Nothing. I met her.
She's nice. You're sure you didn't do anything?
Yeah, I swear.
You did it with her, didn't you, Glenn?
I did not do it with her, Joel!
Ask me about Vicki!
Who is Vicki? Owe you one!
Are you Joel? Nice place you have here.
Where's Lana?
In the den. I like your friend!
Get out!
I'm not kidding! What's your problem?
Just leave! Please!
Look, we're not ripping you off or anything.
What is this for?
Fifty goes to the house!
I am not the house!
Just leave! I mean it!
He's mad, Vicki.
Already? I just got here!
I think he wants us to go.
Do you want us to go? Thank you.
I don't want any problems.
Do you know what you did to me last night?
I don't care!
I don't want to see you or do anything with you anymore.
Get in the car!
Excuse me.
What can I do for you?
Who are you?
Are you the kid I chased last night?
Is there something I can help you with?
You shouldn't drive like that.
People get hurt all the time.
Are you a smart kid?
You look like a smart kid.
I'm okay.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.
The door is locked.
You're starting to give me a stomachache.
Good! I hope it hurts!
Are you going to open the door?
Guido, go home!
We don't need you anymore!
Shut your mouth! Listen, maybe we don't work for you anymore!
Then who do you work for?
Who? If you don't work for me?
Maybe we work for Joel, now.
She's only kidding.
I hope so.
Joel, you look like a smart kid.
I'm going to tell you something I'm sure you'll understand.
You're having fun now, right?
Right, Joel? The time of your life.
In a sluggish economy, never, ever fuck with another man's livelihood!
If you're smart, like I hope you are...
...you aren't going to make me come back here. Thank you, Joel.
It's very decent of you.
Just as long as we understand each other.
One night, then you'll find another place to stay.
As soon as we get in touch with Tandy, we'll have a place.
- Did you try her again?
- She's still out. And my mother's egg?
If I can get my stuff back, I can get the egg.
Then you'll leave? Then we'll leave.
I don't know, Lana.
He has such nice friends. Clean, polite, quick.
I think there's a future here.
What are you studying?
It's a workshop... ...on free enterprise.
We make a product, and then we try to market it.
Do you make a lot of money?
No. Not really.
No, but we... ...get to compete with other student companies.
Actually, it's fucked!
I'm just kidding.
It's really quite competitive.
Do you ever get high, Joel?
Yeah. All the time.
You see, Vicki and I were thinking about getting high.
Maybe going out and getting some ice cream?
You want to come?
I could go for some ice cream right now.
Are you stoned?
No. I do not believe so.
I think you're really wasted!
This is not wasted, Barry.
This is definitely not wasted.
Barry?
- I'm a little wasted! - I know.
- Don't let me do anything stupid. - Don't worry.
Want to take a walk?
How do you like living at home?
It's okay.
I'll be out next year.
I'll bet your folks are nice.
They're gone till Sunday?
Yeah.
Because, I was thinking...
I mean, after your friend came over... ...I couldn't believe it!
A kid our age walks in with a $100!
Glenn.
Where did he get that kind of change?
I don't know.
He said he cashed a bond.
You people have a lot of bonds.
So, I was thinking... ...if we ever got our friends together, we'd make a fortune!
Yeah. You're right.
Do you want to do that?
Do what?
Get our friends together in the next few days.
No. I don't think so.
Make some money. Be a little enterpriser.
Future enterpriser.
Be whatever you want to be.
What if I said I'd be your girlfriend for the next few nights?
No charge?
Hey, I'm not pushing you on the idea.
It's just that my mind keeps working all the time.
Nothing I can do about it. It keeps working and working.
You warm enough?
I'm okay.
How come you left home?
Why?
I was just wondering.
Because my step-father kept coming on to me.
What else do you want to know?
Do you have any brothers and sisters?
I have a brother.
What else?
If you don't want to talk...
No, no. Ask me anything. I don't think you want to talk and it's okay.
No, I really want to talk to you.
What does he do?
He's in school.
How come you're not in school?
I'm not my brother.
I'm really trying to be friends with you.
But I'd appreciate it if you'd stop trying to judge me... ...while you're leaning on your daddy's $40,000 car.
I'll see you around.
Was it something I said? You locked the door!
The keys are inside the car!
Please! Stop! Stop!
Please stop!
Please stop! Thank you.
Thank you.
All right, everyone watch your feet!
Are you okay?
Do you want an aspirin?
Does your dad own a gun?
Who's the U-boat commander?
You're right. You are absolutely right to respond this way.
I did not have a doctor's appointment.
But I will tell you exactly what happened.
"Unexcused." You see, Nurse Bolan... ...If you write "unexcused," I fail two mid-terms.
It'll wreck my whole grade point average!
If you'd just stop and listen to me, I'll explain everything.
The truth is, my parents are away, and I met this girl.
A call girl, actually. She came to my house.
Look, you're writing again!
This is not "unexcused"!
If you will just listen to me, then you'll understand, Nurse Bolan.
Why?
Why won't you listen to me? I had a doctor's appointment.
Excuse me.
It wasn't the girl, it was my father's car.
I put my father's car into Lake Michigan... ...and I had to get it fixed.
Just give me a break.
Let me put it this way.
I have spent the last four years of my life busting my butt in this shithole!
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can leave until I get just a little compassion from you.
What did he get?
Suspension, five days.
They kicked him out of Future Enterprisers, too.
Shit!
They trashed his whole record! What's he going to do about the car?
Are you okay, Joel?
I'm okay.
I need a bike.
He needs a bike. - Glenn, can I borrow your bike?
- Jesus, Glenn! Sure. Here, use mine.
It was great the way her mind worked:
No guilt, no doubts, no fear.
None of my specialties.
Just this shameless pursuit of immediate material gratification.
What a capitalist!
She told me I could make more money in one night than I'd make all year.
Enough to pay for my father's car.
She told me she'd be my girlfriend.
She told me a lot of things.
So, she introduced me to her friends. "Now when I was a young boy
"At the age of five
"I have lots of fun
I introduced her to my friends.
We made Barry our treasurer.
Lana did production.
I concentrated on sales.
So, you took her out to dinner twice.
What did that cost you?
About $30.
With tip? Okay, maybe $35.
Any movies?
Three movies. $20.
Parking? I park on the street.
Gas?
Maybe $6.
All right, Stan, you're in for roughly $60. What happened?
She slept with Jacobsen.
That's all I'm saying.
Do you know what he said... afterwards?
He said the lady had knowledge.
He was glad to get that knowledge.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because college girls can smell ignorance... ...like dog shit.
I'll think about it.
Where are you going to school next year? Wisconsin.
Wisconsin?
Big school.
All I'm saying is... ...walk like a man.
Joel! This is a great party!
Are you having a good time?
Excellent idea, Joel! Really excellent.
Some of the girls are wearing my mother's clothing.
What's wrong with that? I don't want to spend the rest of my life in analysis.
- Just talk to them, okay? - All right. Is Howie Rifkin here?
You're on, honey.
Joel! Somebody is at the front door for you.
All right, thank you. I'll be right there.
The thing is... ...I don't have to pay for it.
I get it anyway.
I'm going to get going or I'll miss the party.
Whatever you want to do... Excuse me.
Can I help you?
Are you Joel?
Yes. Bill Rutherford, Princeton Admissions.
I believe we had an interview scheduled.
If this is inconvenient for you...
No, sir. It's fine.
Is it okay if I have the room?
Also, could you catch the phone if anyone calls, please?
I understand that you would like to attend Princeton.
Yes, sir, very much.
Well, fine.
Let's take a look at what we have, shall we?
Does this couch open?
Lana, I'm in a meeting.
We need the room. I need a few minutes, okay?
Now, you've taken your SAT's already.
Math: 597, Verbal: 560.
Correct me if my information is inaccurate.
Well, yes, but I was planning on taking those again.
Fine. Now, your grade point average is 3.14.
You class rank:
52... ...which places you in the 84th percentile.
Is that correct? Joel, this is my cousin, Ruben, from Skokie.
Can you get him in tonight?
Not now, okay? - He has to be back by 12:00.
- All right, later guys. Excuse me.
And you wish to major in?
Business.
Business. Yes.
I'll be out in a second.
Fine, well, let's see what else there is.
"Junior Varsity Tennis Team, Recording Secretary, Spanish Club... "...Varsity Track Team:
One year... "...Honorable Mention:
Cook County Science Fair... "...Future Enterprisers, Yearbook Staff... "...Student Council:
Well, Joel, this is very respectable.
You've done some very solid work here... ...but it isn't quite Ivy League, is it?
You know, Bill... ...there's one thing I've learned in all my years.
Sometimes you have to say, "What the fuck."
Make your move.
I beg your pardon?
So, how are we doing?
Looks like University of illinois! "All right, all right!  "Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!
Some of your friends are looking for you.
What do you want me to tell them?
Has that guy from Princeton left yet?
No, he's still here.
He's talking to some of the girls.
Talking? They're very good talkers.
I don't think I'm going to say, "What the fuck" anymore.
This thing has gotten way out of control.
I'm going to kill Miles.
Oh, come on, Joel.
Look at it this way. You're making a lot of money.
You're providing your friends with an invaluable service.
God knows, they needed the service!
And, right now, you are one hot-shit future enterpriser.
Don't worry so much. I'll be upstairs.
And... you have a girlfriend to boot.
Do I?
Phone call for Joel.
Here, I'll get it.
Well, do I?
What do you think?
I don't know.
You tell me. Yes? No?
Yes.
No.
Maybe.
Joel!
Dad?
Who answered the phone? Just a friend, Dad.
Do I know her? Have you ever made love on a real train?
I don't think so.
He's got a girl.
Let's make love on a real train.
Joel, are you there?
I'm still here, Dad. How is Mom? Is everything all right?
Let's go. Did I hear others there?
Just a few friends, Dad. Sounds like a party.
A party?
Come on, let's be alone together.
I don't remember giving permission for a party, Joel.
Honey, can you hear me?
There's nothing wrong with having friends over.
Just use your best judgment.
We trust you. We're coming in on United, Flight 162 at 3:30.
"Trust."
Seems to me if there were any logic to our language... ..."trust" would be a four-letter word.
The evening worked out well. We had a good cash flow.
Rutherford made a few new friends.
He said he'd do his best for me.
Finally, it was time to close shop.
The girls were exhausted.
Lana was hungry. She wanted to go out for a bite.
She wanted to make love on a real train.
Who was I to say no?
"Can you feel it coming" I thought no one was going to be here.
Be patient. "Well, I remember  "I remember - don't worry
Hi.
They stole the goddamn house, Lana! I'm not here right now.
But if you'll leave your name and number... ...I'll call you back as soon as possible.
They took everything!
This is unbelievable! My parents will be home in two hours, Lana, and they took fucking everything!
I don't know if you know anything about this... ...but you have to call me right away!
KL5-2121. Look, you've really got to help me!
Time of your life, huh, kid?
Where's Lana?
Maybe she's on the choo-choo. I hear she's got this thing about choo-choos.
I want to know who took my stuff.
I took your stuff, Joel, are you kidding?
Then you listen to me, buster!
You a-hole! If I don't get my stuff back...
Shit!
"A-hole?"
I want my furniture back, right now!
Now, you listen to me.
No, no! You listen to me!
Shit!
This is getting boring.
Can I have my furniture back? Please?
You listen to me, you little fuck!
You not only took my two best girls... ...you call me names and insult me!
I'm sorry.
If I had any self-respect... ...it wouldn't just be the furniture... ...it would be your legs!
Do we understand each other?
Yes, we do. No! Do we understand each other?
Yes, we understand each other.
Well, you're lucky in one respect.
What's that?
I like you, Joel.
Don't you know that?
What time is it?
It's 4:15.
I'll find a cab.
Something must have happened.
Taxi!
Joel, do you like music?
This is beautiful equipment.
What do you say, $300... ...amps, speakers, the works?
It's a bargain, Joel. If you go downtown anywhere, it'd cost you double that.
All right! The kid likes music!
How about some women's outfits?
You know, something for your mom? Should fit her okay.
Yes.
What? Yes, I'll buy it!
I didn't give you a price yet.
Can we get through this, please? $125.
That's it, you have everything.
What about this?
What's that?
Some glass, artsy-fartsy thing.
What have you got left, Joel? $40.
I don't think I can go $40 on the artsy-fartsy thing.
- What do you think, Vic?
- He's only got $40. I only have $40.
We go $340?
I'll spot you the $300.
You're good for it, right?
Certainly.
I think he is too.
Here!
Catch! To Joel!
Here's wishin' you good luck on your future as a businessman!
Because, God knows, you're going to need it! Don't, you'll break it!
That's good.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I'd put all the Chinese things together, and the Greek on a separate shelf.
I don't think you should mix centuries.
Mom! Dad!
You're home!
Where were you?
I was here.
We called from the airport! I must have been out back watering.
I thought you were coming home tomorrow.
Sweetheart, I said the 5th.
No, you said the 6th. I wrote it down.
I'm sure I said the 5th.
Give me a hand with the luggage.
She said the 6th.
Joel? Yes, Mom?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
What happened to my egg?
What do you mean?
There's a crack in it!
You're kidding!
No, Joel, I'm not kidding.
There's a small crack, inside the egg.
What's wrong? My egg is ruined.
What happened?
I don't know.
Mom, maybe it was there before.
I don't think so, Joel.
How could you let this happen?
I'm sorry.
This is so damned irresponsible of you!
We'll get another one. Joel will pay for it.
Sure, I'll pay for it.
Where will you get the money to pay for something like that?
I'm very disappointed in you.
She'll be all right. Why don't you put in some yard work?
Do you have something to tell me?
No... ...I don't think so.
I just got off the telephone with Bill Rutherford.
Apparently, you two had quite a meeting.
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."
What?
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."
His exact words!
That's unbelievable!
You're as good as in!
I knew you could do it!
Haven't I been telling you, sometimes you have to say:
"What the heck!" Take some chances.
You were so right.
You've made me very proud.
I was just thinking... ...where we might be ten years from now.
You know what I think?
I think we're both going to make it big!
I'm very optimistic! I mean it!
Can I ask you something?
Was our night together...
...just to set up... ...Vicki and Guido?
No.
You don't believe me, do you?
My name is Russell Bitterman. I'm from Wheaton High School.
Our product is a paper-towel holder that sells for $8.95.
We made a profit of $850 last semester.
I don't want you to get hurt.
My name is Evonne Williams. We sell decorative planters for $7.
We made a profit of $500 last semester.
Guess we won't see each other for awhile.
I know.
Are you going straight home now?
I don't know.
Why? It might be nice if we spent the evening together.
I'd really like that.
How much have you got on you?
How much have I got on me?
I've got $20. $20, Lana?
What are we going to do about this?
- Can I send it to you? - Can you send it to me?
'Cause I don't have that much here.
How about I write you a check?
Do you think I'd accept a check from you?
What am I, stupid?
I have a bond at the bank.
My name is Joel Goodson.
I deal in human fulfillment.
I grossed over $8,000 in one night.
The time of your life, huh, kid?
Bingo.
Fucking hell.
Fucking hell.
Oh, God.
Keep your shit together… if you wanna get 'em out of here.
I can pop these, no problem!
So get to it! Security, we have a break-in.
Get to sector…
I know who you are.
I know what you think you're doing…
If you don't wanna get hurt… keep your mouth shut… and don't move a fuckin' muscle.
The chimps are infected! They're highly contagious.
They've been given an inhibitor.
Infected with what? In order to cure, you must first understand.
Infected with what?!
Rage.
What the fuck he's talking about?! We don't have time for this!
Get the cages open! No! No!
No! Listen, you sick bastard.  We're going, and we're taking… your torture victims with us.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Listen, the animals are contagious. The infection is in their blood and saliva.
One bite-Stop!
You've no idea… Aah!  No!
Get it off! Oh, God!
Help me! Get it off!
Get it off!
I'm burning!
What the fuck is the matter with her?! We have to kill her!
Aah! Oh, my God!
Aah! What's the matter with her?!
We have to kill her now!
Oh, God. Aah.  Hello?
Hello?
Hello?!
Hello?!
Hello?!
Hello?
Hello?
Father?
Father, are you okay?
Oh, I shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have done that.
Shit!
— Over here! — Move it!
Over here!
Come on! Burn!  Come on!
Go! Go! Go!
Keep going!
What the fuck is going on?
Just shut up!
Who are those people?
Wha-hoo! Let's go.
Let's go! Please tell me what the fuck is going on.
Just move! Come on!
A man walks into a bar with a giraffe. They each get pissed.
The giraffe falls over.
The man goes to leave. The barman says, "Oi… you can't leave that lyin' there."
He says, "No, it's not a lion.
It's a giraffe." He's completely humorless.
You two should get on like a house on fire.
So, who are you?
Well, you're from a hospital, yeah?
You're a doctor. He's not a doctor. He's a patient.
Look, I'm a bicycle courier.
I was riding a package from, uh, Farringdon… to Shaftesbury Avenue when a car cut across me.
And then I wake up today in hospital. I wake up, and I'm…  I'm hallucinating, or I'm…
What's your name?
Jim.
I'm Mark. This is Selena.
Okay, Jim…
I've got some bad news.
It started as rioting… and right from the beginning… you knew this was different… because it was happening… in small villages, market towns.
And then it wasn't on the TV anymore.
It was in the street outside… it was coming through your windows.
It was a virus, an infection.
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.
It was the blood.
Or something in the blood.
By the time they tried to evacuate the cities… it was already too late.
The infection was everywhere.
The army blockades were overrun.
And that's when the exodus started.
The day before the TV… and radio stopped broadcasting… there were reports of infection… in Paris and New York.
You didn't hear anything more after that.
What about the government? What are they doing?
There's no government.
Of course there's a government.
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane.
No, there's no government… no police… no army… no TV, no radio, no electricity.
You're the first uninfected person… we've seen in 6 days.
Where's your family?
They're dead, like Selena's… yours will be dead, too.
No. Look, I have to find them.
They live in Deptford. I can walk it, okay?
What, you'll go and come back, yeah?
Get the fucking-Fuck! — You won't! — Yes!
No one ever comes back.
So, lesson one:
You never go anywhere alone… unless you've got no choice.
And lesson 2:
Only travel during daylight… unless you've got no choice.
We'll take you tomorrow.
We'll all go and find your dead parents together, okay?
Eat.
If you want to slow down… you'll have to say.
If there's anyone in there who is…
I understand. Anyone.
I understand. Okay.  Jim.
Wait, Jim.
They died peacefully. You should be grateful.
I'm not grateful.
My, um… parents and my sisters… we went to Paddington Station… hoping maybe we could get on a plane… maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.
I remember my dad had all this cash… even though cash was completely useless.
About 20,000 other people… had the same idea.
The crowd was surging.
I lost my grip on my sister's hand.
I remember the ground was soft.
I looked down, and I was standing… on all these people, like a carpet… people who had fallen.
And somewhere in the crowd… there were infected.
It spread fast.
No one could run.
All you could do was climb… climb over more people.
I climbed, and I got up on top of this kiosk.
Looking down, you couldn't tell… which faces were infected… and which weren't.
Then I saw my dad… not my mum or my sister, my dad.
His face.
Selena's right. You should be grateful.
We don't have time… to get back to the shop before dark. We should stay here tonight.
My room is up at the top. You two can have that.
I'll stay here.
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. It's safer.
It was recorded… at the Buxton Summer Music Festival last July… and it's presented by Petrov Trelawny. Jim.  Ah, you're back.
Yeah.
How was it?
Fine.
Give me a drink of that, will you?
It's empty.
Ah. Here.  Right.
I'll start working on them, then.
Fight! Fight! Selena!
It's clear.
That's Mr. Bridges. Were you bitten?
That's his daughter.
They live 4 doors down.
Were you bitten? No.
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?
No. Mark?
Wait.
Get that cleaned off.
Do you have any clothes here?
Um, l-yes.
Then get them and get dressed. We have to leave now.
More infected will be coming.
They always do. How did you know?
I mean, how did you know he was infected?
The blood. Yeah, but there was blood everywhere.  It was on me.
It was on you.
I didn't know he was infected, okay? He knew. I could see it in his face.
Look, if someone gets infected… you've got between 10 and 20 seconds to kill them.
It might be your brother or your sister… or your oldest friend. It makes no difference.
And just so you know where you stand… if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.
He was full of plans. Have you got any plans, Jim?
Do you want us to find a cure and save the world… or just fall in love and fuck?
Plans are pointless.
Staying alive's as good as it gets.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's that?
Let's go.
What is it about tower blocks… and shopping trolleys, huh?
Stop talking. It's a long way up.
Do you need a break?
No.
— You? — No.
Now I do need a break… by the way.
What's up?
Nothin'.
Got a headache.
Bad?
Yeah, it's pretty bad. Well, why didn't you say something before?  Well, because I didn't think you'd give a shit.
You've got no fat on you… and all you've had to eat is sugar… so you're crashing.
Unfortunately, there isn't a lot… we can do about that… except pump you full of painkillers… and give you more sugar.
As for sugar, Pepsi or Lilt?
Do you have any Tango?
Actually, I did have a can of Tango somewhere.
Quiet! That's an infected.
Oh, no. They're in.
Move! Wait, Selena!
Wait for me, please!
Wait, Selena!
Please wait for me! — Selena! — Come on! — Wait! — Run!
Wait, for fuck's sake!
Selena! Aah!
Down the corridor, flat 157!
Move!
Thank you! Thank you!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open up! Where's Dad?
What?!
Open the fucking door! Where's Dad?!
Fucking open the door!
Hannah, let them inside.
Go in.
Go in. So, I'm Frank, anyway.
Jim. Selena.
Selena, good to meet you. This is my daughter Hannah.
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.
Come on.
So…
This is great.
It's just great.
Calls for a celebration, I'd say.
Why don't you all sit down… and, uh, Hannah, what have we got to offer?
We've got Mum's crème de menthe.
Great. Her crème de menthe.
Aye.
Look, sit, please.
Get comfortable.
Where are the bloody glasses?! Middle cupboard.
No, the good ones. It's a celebration.
Top cupboard.
So…So, this is your place?
It's nice.
Yeah. Now…
I know it isn't much, but, well, cheers.
Cheers.
You okay in there, Jim?
Yeah.
Sorry we couldn't spare the water. Same with the toilet.  The, urn, flush doesn't work.
Afraid you'll have to use the bucket.
Have to empty it each morning, you know.
Just chuck it over the balcony. No mod cons here.
Yeah.
It's fine.
Yeah, all right, listen… it's late. I'm gonna turn in.
We have a spare room… in there.
Are you and Selena…
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Um, no, I'll take the living room.
It's fine.
Right.
Oh, no, I mean, yeah.
Yeah, so, um, all right.
Okay, good night, then, anyway. Yeah, good night, Frank.
Very spruce.
Yeah… very shredded.
Yeah. So what do you make of them?
Well, they're desperate.
Probably need us more than we need them.
I think they're good people.
Good people? Yeah.
Well, that's nice… but you should be more concerned… about whether they're gonna slow you down.
Right, because if they slowed you down…
I'd leave them behind. — In a heartbeat. — Yeah.
I wouldn't.
Then you're gonna wind up getting yourself killed.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
Selena… you think I don't get it… but, um, I do get it.
And I know I'd be dead already… if I hadn't met you.
Sure.
No, look…
I mean thank you.
And I mean sure.
Good night, Jim.
Good night.
We lost water pressure 3 weeks ago.
For a while, I thought we'd be okay… with the water in the other flats… cisterns, and tanks… but it vanishes so quick, you wouldn't believe.
You drink it.
It evaporates… turns stagnant.
They're all empty.
Hasn't rained in 10 days.
You can set up a plastic sheet… to catch dew and condensation… trap it somehow.
I saw it on TV once, but I can't make it work.
You'd never think it… needing rain so badly.
Not in fucking England.
Jim, we're not gonna be able to stay here.
There haven't been any broadcasts for weeks.
Just listen. …Salvation is here.
The answer to infection is here.
If you can hear this, you're not alone.
There are others like you. There are fighters, other survivors.
We are soldiers, and we are armed.
Oh, my God. Soldiers.
Quiet. There's more.
Our location is the 42nd Blockade… the M602, 27 miles northeast of Manchester.
You must find us. Salvation is… Then it just repeats.
What, so it's a recording?
Yeah, it's a recording… but this is where it's telling us to go.
Just there.
The way things are… we might need 2, 3 days to get up there.
Um, "we"?
Sound carries in this flat. You know, jerry-built, I suppose.  Me and Hannah do need you… more than you need us.
Look, I didn't…
That's okay.
It's the truth.
I can't leave the block… if it's just the two of us.
Something might happen to me. Hannah'd be alone.
I couldn't risk it… but with other people…
If it's a recording, for all we know… the soldiers who made it are dead.
It's possible, yeah. And that stuff about the answer to infection…
I mean, there is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.
Maybe they have a cure. Maybe they've got nothing at all.
Well, the only way to find out is to reach them! We could die trying, Frank!
Or die here… and anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.
We need each other… and we'll never be safe in the cities.
So we have to try and get there.
Get there how?
Just so you know… I don't take checks or credit cards.
What do you think? Well, it's the most direct route… to the other side of the river.
No, no, no, then we should take… the indirect route… the one that's in broad daylight… and that's not underground.
Let's just get it done.
No, no.
No, see, this is a really shit idea.
You know why? Because it's really obviously a shit idea.
So, we're just gonna drive into a tunnel… full of fuckin' smashed cars and broken glass.
It's just really fucking obviously a shit idea!
Hold on!
Dad!
— Aah! — Whoa! Fuck!
World's worst place to get a flat, huh?
Agreed. I think we better do this quick.
I've got the wheel.
You're on the jack. Hey, did you hear that?
Hey, hey. Did you hear that?
Hear what?
Right, I've done it.
Dad?
Jesus Christ!
Oh, no!
Fucking rats!
Aah! Come on, Hannah, out! Out!
They're running from the infected.
Move it!
Forget the jack, Hannah! Don't look at them!  There's no time!
Just lift, everyone!
Grab hold!
Lift! Lift! Lift!
Don't look at them! Don't look at them! I can see them!
They're coming! Aah! Come on, Hannah!
Put it on!
Almost!
Get the tire on, Hannah! — All right! — Get it on, Hannah!
3… 2… 1… Drop it!
Inside, everyone! Inside!
Get in the cab! Get in the cab!
Get in the fucking cab!
Frank, drive!
Aah! Whoo!  Bye-bye, you fuckers!
Whoo! Hey, Frank, Frank, stop the cab.
Let's shop.
Rrr! Rrr!
You…
You… You…
Has anybody seen any buns?
Mmm.
Irradiated.
And don't take anything that needs to be cooked, okay?
I think you can eat that raw.
Decaffeinated coffee.
Put that back.
Can't just take any crap.
If I never see another chocolate bar again… it will be too soon.
Not counting Terry's chocolate orange, of course!
There.
Now, single malt, 16-year-old.
Dark, full-flavor.
Warm, but not aggressive.
Peaty aftertaste.
Yeah.
Takes out the fire, but leaves in the warmth.
Ha ha ha. Either we do this now, or we're walking.
Not you.
Stay close, Jim.
What?
You heard me.
Where are you going?
We've got enough food, Jim.
We don't have any cheeseburgers.
Like going on holidays with your fuckin' aunt.
Oh, Jesus. Hello?
I hate you!
Find anything?
Find anything, Jim? No. Let's get out of here.
Okay, we're done here.
Okay, Hannah!
Steady. Easy.
Brake. Brake!
Brake! Out.
Mmm!
Oh, my God!
I can, like, taste the vitamin "C."
Okay, the raisins are still moist.
What did you say?
The raisins, yeah?
They're still moist. Look over here.
Like a family.
Do you think they're infected?
No. They're doing just fine.
Come on. Let's eat!
Do you know what I was thinking?
You were thinking that you'll never hear… another piece of original music ever again.
You'll never read a book… that hasn't already been written… or see a film that hasn't already been shot.
Urn, that's what you were thinking.
No.
I was thinking I was wrong.
About what?
All the death… all the shit.
It doesn't really mean anything… to Frank and Hannah, because…
Well, she's got a dad… and he's got his daughter, so…
Cheeky monkey.
I was wrong when I said… that staying alive is as good as it gets.
You see, that's what I was thinking.
Was it? Mmm.
You stole my thought.
Sorry.
That's okay.
You keep it.
It's getting late. Think we better stay here for the night.
Can't sleep.
Me neither.
Doesn't feel safe, does it?
Outside like this.
I think we're safe enough.
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.
Yeah, I noticed that.
Hey, Selena.
What?
What is it?
How did you get to sleep?
Oh. Bloody hell.
You must have needed… a hell of a prescription for that lot.
I didn't need a prescription. I qualified as a chemist.
Oh, great, Valium.
Not only will we be able to get to sleep… but if we're attacked in the middle of the night… we won't even care.
2 each. No, not for me, thanks.
Can I, Dad?
I don't think so, sweetheart.
Please?
No. I can't sleep.
Come on, Frank.
Let her live a little.
Give her half of one. All right. We're on.
Night-night.
You're a big softie, Frank.
Frank? Hannah?  Frank?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Shh.
You're having a bad dream, that's all.
Thanks, Dad.
Come on, sleepyhead.
Come on, Babe Ruth.
Hurry up.
Oh, no. Did I miss breakfast?  You'll sleep through anything, you.
Did you have a fry-up? Maybe stop at a pub along the way?  Door.
…We can feed you and we can protect you.
Our location is the 42nd Blockade… the M602, 27 miles northeast of Manchester.
You must find us, please.
Salvation is here.
The answer to infection is here.
— Sure? — Yo. Must be Manchester.
The whole of Manchester. The whole city.
No fire crews to put it out.
42nd Blockade.
This is it.
I don't understand, Dad. Did they leave?
I don't like this. I think we should go.  No!
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.  There has to be something.
Nothing.
Can't believe it.
Frank. Frank.  We have to go?
Yeah.
Go fucking where?!
Get out of it.
Get out of it.
Dad, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.
Sorry I lost my temper.
Hannah.
I love you very much.
What?
Keep away from me.
Stay where you are. — Ow. — Dad? — Keep away from me! — Dad?
Keep away from me! — Keep away from me! — Dad! — Keep away from me! — Dad!
Keep away!
Keep away!
What's wrong? Dad!
Jim!
Jim, he's infected!
No! No!
Jim!
Jim, kill him! — Dad! — Kill him!
Kill him!
Stay away from him!
Keep away from the body!
Dad?
3 survivors… one male, 2 female.
I repeat, one male, 2 female.
ETA 15.
Put the kettle on.
I'm Major Henry West.
Welcome. Jim.
Hello, Jim. Hello.
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets… and a boiler that produces hot water… so you can all have a shower.
You look like you need one. Please.
It ain't funny. I've got loads of cooking to do.  You fucking Doris.
Please!
Run him over! I want to start cooking.
How's she doing?
Well, she's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.
It's all fucked.
What do you mean?
No, don't do that. Don't do that. Don't…
Hey, don't do that.
Look, Hannah is what Frank said she is, okay? She's tough, and she's strong… and she'll cope just like I'll cope… and just like you'll cope.
I don't want her to have to fucking cope.
I want her to be okay.
When Hannah had her dad, it was okay.
It was okay for them, and it was okay for us.
Now it's all just fucked.
So you heard our broadcast?
Yeah, we did. We must be a disappointment.
You were hoping for a full brigade… an army base with helicopters… and a field hospital.
I was just hoping for…
The answer to infection.
Yeah.
Well, as I said before, it's here… though it may not be quite what you imagined.
Just feel very lucky to have found you. You were lucky.
The fire drove hundreds of infected… out of Manchester.
The surrounding area is teeming with them.
But don't worry.
You're quite safe here.
Flat terrain all around the house… floodlights… which we've rigged up to a generator… high perimeter wall, which helps… and we've been lacing the ground… with trip wires and land mines.
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn… but if they get in, we hear them.
Secondary to protection… our real job is to rebuild… start again.
The belly of the house… the heart.
A wood-fired boiler… providing us with hot water… the first step towards civilization.
The kitchen.
Here, I'll swap you.
A bit of Kendal Mint Cake, right?
Well, wait. Now, don't be throwing it. Don't be…
Now, don't be fighting. Will you put that back?  Put it back.
Jones, our resident tin-opener.
What are you cooking, Jones? Surprise, sir.
I can't wait.
And lastly, meet Mailer.
Mailer, Jim.
Jim, Mailer.
Got infected 2 days ago.
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold… and we got a chain around his neck.
You're keeping him alive?
The idea was to learn something about infection… have him teach me.
And has he?
In a way.
He's telling me he'll never bake bread… plant crops… raise livestock.
He's telling me he's futureless…
and eventually… he'll tell me how long the infected take… to starve to death.
Will there be chips or jacket spuds? Will there be salad or frozen peas?  Will there be mushrooms?
Fried onion rings? You'll have to wait and see
Hope it's chips, it's chips
We hope it's chips, it's chips
We hope it's chips… Hat.
So… what have we here?
Tinned ham, tinned peas… tinned beans, and…
Nice one, Doris. Omelet.
You've prepared a feast, Jones. Honor of our guests, sir.
Absolutely.
I was going to propose a toast… but this omelet will do just as well.
To new friends.
New friends. Jones, did you notice while cooking… that these eggs were off?
I thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.
Get rid of it.
Doris, you twat.
I don't suppose you can cook, can you?
I can't tell you how badly we need… someone with a little flair in the kitchen.
What a fucking disappointment. When I saw those eggs…
I thought it was Christmas.
We'll all have eggs again… once everything's back to normal.
Oh, you muppet. I mean, look at him, eh?
Look, he's still waiting… for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.
Listen, mate, you don't know nothing. Well, I think Bell's got a point.
If you look at the whole life of the planet… we… you know, man… has only been around for a few blinks of an eye.
So if the infection wipes us all out… that is a return to normality.
That what you meant, Bell? Yeah, yeah.
Have you, uh… have you met our new-age sergeant?
Our spiritual guru.
Tell me, Farrell… exactly why did you join the army… in the first place?
This is what I've seen… in the 4 weeks since infection…
People killing people… which is much what I saw… in the 4 weeks before infection… and the 4 weeks before that… and before that.
As far back as I care to remember… people killing people… which, to my mind… puts us in a state of normality right now.
You're not eating? I don't want to eat.
You must eat, Hannah.
I don't want to eat.
I want to bury my dad.
He's one of the people you're talking about.
Stand to! Stand to! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Move! Move!
Move! Come on! Let's go!
Enemy front!
2, 3… 6, 7, 8, 9. Mitch, I fucking got one!
What do you want, a fucking sweetie? Keep shooting, you cunt!
Fucking hell!
He bounced!
Cease fire!
I ain't ever seen that in my fucking life!
Front 4 clear?
Fucking hell! — Clear! — Clear!
Clear, yeah, clear.
Good, weren't it, eh? Hey, that was fucking marvelous.  I'm telling you, fucking marvelous.
Oh, hello.
Listen, sweetheart… you ain't gonna be needing this anymore. Eh?
'Cause you got me to protect you now.
Go on, Mitch.
Go on. You wanna get your hands on a really big chopper… well, you just come and see me.
Fuck you.
Well, that's an offer, Mitch. Yeah, all right.
How about right now?
Mitchell!
Easy, tiger. You don't want to go picking a fight with me, son.
Sergeant Farrell!
Mitchell, first action on? Resecure the perimeter, sir.
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.
Slow down.
Sergeant. Sir.
Clear the bodies off the lawn.
The rest of you go with him.
My apologies.
Drink?
Look, we're grateful, okay?
We're very grateful for your protection… and just having found other people… but if we're gonna stay here…
Who have you killed?
I haven't killed anyone. Since it began, who have you killed?  You wouldn't be alive now… if you hadn't killed somebody.
I killed, uh…
I killed a boy.
A child?
Yes.
But you had to. Otherwise, he'd have killed you.
Survival.
I understand.
I promised them women.
What?
8 days ago, I found Jones… with his gun in his mouth.
He said he was going to kill himself… because there was no future.
What could I say to him?
We fight off the infected… or we wait until they starve to death… and then what?
What do 9 men do except wait to die themselves?
I moved us from the blockade… I set the radio broadcasting… and I promised them women…
'cause women mean a future.
Selena?
Hannah?
What is it, Jim? We have to go!
Jim, wait… No time!
Come on!
Come on!
Look, we get in the cab, and we go!
No! You're not gonna keep 'em here! You've got to let 'em go!
You cannot keep 'em here! Stay where you are!
I'll fuckin' shoot you!
I'm not gonna let you keep 'em here!
You can't do this!
Don't any of you move!
Get hold of him!
Get hold of him! I can't get hold of him!  Break his fingers.
Knock him out! I want to give you a chance.
You can be with us… but I can't let them go.
Okay, Jim?
Okay. Him, too.
Marge walks onto this ship.
Smithers says, "Women and seamen don't mix"… and Mr. Burns says…
"We all know what you think, Smithers."
And that was my favorite ever joke in The Simpsons.
You see, that's what they're doing… a few hundred miles from here across the channel… a-across the Atlantic.
They're eatin' dinner… and they're watchin' The fuckin' Simpsons.
They're sleeping in their beds next to their wives… but we're here… chained to a fuckin' radiator… because the O.C. has gone insane!
Starting the world again… when the rest of the fucking world hasn't even stopped.
Just imagine.
Just think about it.
How could infection cross the oceans?
How could it cross the mountains and the rivers? They stopped it.
And right now TVs are playing… and planes are flying in the sky… and the rest of the world… is continuing as fucking normal.
Think… actually think about it.
What would you do with a diseased little island?
They quarantined us.
There is no infection.
It's just people killing people. He's insane!
Time to go.
Quarantine?
Ugh. Please.
Believe me, I'm not interested.
You see, I'm gonna have the black one… and I'm gonna make her squeal.
Mitchell… I swear to God it's gonna end badly for you.
Move.
Come on. Move!
Get up!
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!
Get up!
Move your fucking ass!
Come on, then, you fucking pansies. Do me first.
Maybe I won't. Mitch, just use the gun.
So, you're gonna stick me, Mitchell… is that it?
Mitchell, shoot him!
Why?
Because it's fucking quicker!
Is that how you're gonna let… your sergeant go out, Jones?
I'll fuckin' shoot them, then.
No, you won't.
You're gonna let him stick me, are you… like a fuckin' dog?
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Aaaah!
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
What, you wanna shoot me, do you? You wanna fuckin' shoot me?  I'll fuckin' kill you, you little cunt!
Fuck it! Get up!
Get after him! Jones, move!
Jones! Move left! I don't see him.
I don't see him!
Where are you?
Where is he? Okay, get back!  Where is he?
Jones, can you see him? Through there!
Spray him! Oh, no… we're fucked.
We're fucked!
Relax.
He's over the wall.
He's got no vehicle… and no shooter.
He's dead.
Ugh! Now, the first thing we're going do… is make you look a little more presentable.
It so happens that the lady of the house… has an extensive wardrobe… which she certainly has no use for.
No!
You can't do it to Hannah.
Go to the master bedroom. Pick out a wide selection.
Yes, sir.
No. No.
Ladies.
Come on. It's only dressing up.
I thought girls liked dressing up. Expensive dresses, these are.
Come on.
Relax yourself.
Selena!
Go on, Cliff. Selena! Selena!
You need to leave me alone with Hannah. Okay?
Listen, right, the O.C., he wants…
Yeah, he wants us to dress up nice.
If you want us to get changed… you have to leave the room. Okay?
It's just polite.
Yeah, yeah, all right.
All right.
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.
Okay… you're gonna eat these, Hannah. Okay?
Come on. You eat these.
Eat these.
Are you trying to kill me?
No, sweetheart.
I'm making you not care.
Okay?
What the fuck are you doing?
Someone's at the blockade!
Jim! Come on, move!
Stay here and put the dresses on.
Well, let's go!
Go! He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead, sir.
Shut up, Jones! Stay here!
Ugh! Davis?
Fuck it!
What was that? Lightning.
I heard something.
It sounded like a claymore to me.
All right. I'll go and hit the floods, take a butcher's.
Girls… keep an eye on him, will you?
Those pills…
I think they're having an effect.
I can feel them… and…
I don't feel sleepy… but…
They've been a long time.
What are you gonna do if they don't come back?
Would you be the officer if Henry is dead?
Is that the way it works?
Shut up.
I don't think they are coming back. I think they've been killed.
I said shut up! Hannah.
They're dead… and you're gonna be next.
Get up!
God!
We're gonna get out of here. Stay with it, Hannah.
Stay with it.
Don't worry. I feel fine.
Really.
Get him off me!
Get him off me! It's jammed!
It's jammed!
Aah! Oi!
Where the fuck are you going, eh? What's all the fuckin' shoutin' about?
Well, don't just stand there, you soppy cunt! Get after'em!
You two, in the house.
Move! Come on, then.
What the fuck are you gonna do now?
Clifton! Come on, up! Up!
Corp… Defend these stairs with your fucking life!
Hannah!
Mailer's loose.
Ugh! Sorry.
Shh, soldier. Shh.  Hannah?
Hannah? Selena?  I haven't got any bullets.
I haven't got any fucking bullets!
Don't fuckin' leave me!
Move! Move! Come on!
Move!
Move! Move!
It's just you and me now, darling… but don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Then we're gonna find a nice little… fucking place somewhere.
Just you and me… and we'll live happily ever after, eh?
I just need a moment, all right? I just need time to fucking think.  Aaaah!
That was longer than a heartbeat.
Jim?
Listen…
Listen, all right.
It's not all fucked. We're gonna be okay.
It's not all fucked.
We've got a chance. — I've seen it. — Shut up.
It's gonna be okay. — Yeah. — It's gonna be okay. — Yeah. — It's gonna be okay.
Ugh! Hannah, it's okay!  He's not infected.
But I thought he was biting you.
I was kissing her! Are you stoned?  It's a long story.
We have to get out of here.
Come on. Come on, move!
You killed all my boys.
Wait.
Hannah!
Hannah.
Hannah! Hannah!  No!
Get in.
Aaaaah! Aaaah.  Aaaah!
They're locked.
The gates are locked!
Just fuckin' do it!
Come on, Jim. Breathe!
Fucking breathe! Oh, not the curtains as well.
You looked all right in this, you know.
It's coming!
You definitely heard it, Hannah?
Yes.
I can't hear anything. I told you.
I heard it. Go!
Lads, let's get a helicopter in.
Do you think he saw us this time?
Tension that had been brewing for months in Nigeria exploded yesterday... ...as exiled Gen. Mustafa Yakubu orchestrated a swift and violent coup... ...against the democratically elected government of President Samuel Azuka.
In the land with 1 20 million people and over 250 ethnic groups... ...there'd been a long history of ethnic enmity... ...particularly between northern Fulani Moslems and southern Christian Ibo.
The victorious Fulani rebels have taken to the streets... ...as outbursts of violence continue all over the country.
Thousands have been killed in the fighting or executed thereafter.
Fearing ethnic cleansing, most Ibo have abandoned their homes... ...and are fleeing the city or searching for sanctuary wherever they may find it.
Gen. Yakubu has taken control of most of the country... ...and appears firmly in charge.
There's no word on the United Nations' reaction to the coup... ...but United States forces have already begun to evacuate its embassy.
As you can see behind me, on the USS Harry S. Truman... ...activity is high as foreign nationals are evacuated from aII over Nigeria.
This once peacefuI country... ...has been rocked by a series of ethnic unrests and brief but bitter battles... ...mainly over controI of Nigeria's vast oiI supply.
However, nothing can prepare the country... ...for the overwhelming and decisive action that has just taken place.
We have just heard that the entire presidentiaI family... ...has been assassinated.
The entire presidentiaI family has been assassinated.
-Welcome aboard, Mr. Ambassador. -Thank you.
Let me take those for you.
He got one in the Ieg!
Put him in the sickbay now!
WeIl, Iook at you.
-Welcome back. -Thank you.
We appreciate you've been humping out there, but we have to put you back in.
Priority tasking. We need to extract a criticaI personality ASAP.
Now get some chow, refit for a three-day LLRP.
See you in chow to debrief. You...
-...go see the medic. -Aye, captain.
Attention on deck.
As you were, gentlemen. Sit down.
Everybody get chow?
-Yes, sir. -Okay.
Now, inteI estimates 5000 Yakubu troops... ...scattered throughout this sector.
They've captured government armories... ...and unfortunately, we have been supplying them for far too many years.
In addition, the IocaI militia are kiIling anyone who goes to a different church.
AII right, now, your prime objective is to find and extract... ...Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks with InternationaI Relief Services.
Dr. Kendricks is an American by marriage.
Her Iate husband was Dr. John Kendricks.
Your secondary objective... ...is to extract two nuns and a priest who run a feel-good near Yolingo... ...if they so choose to Ieave.
St. Michael's Mission, right here.
You wiII halo over Cameroon... ...and float into your DZ near the edge of the Mazon Rain Forest.
When you get your package... ...you wiII proceed to your extract LZ Alpha.
Our presence on the ground wiII be considered hostile.
-Questions?
-Sir... ...rules of engagement?
You wiII defend yourselves if you're fired upon. Otherwise, do not engage.
Sir, what's our escape-and-evasion plan?
PatroI the Cameroon border through the Tandjile Pass.
Anything else, gentlemen?
AII right.
Dismissed.
Gentlemen, three minutes out.
It's okay. It's okay.
You speak English? You speak English?
Good. Good.  I'm not gonna hurt you.
Are there any soldiers here? Any rebeI soldiers?
You sure? You sure?
Good. Good.  Can you take me to Dr. Lena Kendricks?
Do you know who she is? Okay, here we go.
Nice and easy. Come on.
Zee, we're moving.
It's aII right. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
Open.
Clear.
Lasana, where's that wa--?
These American men are here to see you!
I'm Lt. Waters with the U.S. Navy. I'm here to get you and your people out.
We're in the middle of surgery here.
Ma'am, you don't realize what's about to happen here.
Are you a nun? Are you one of the nuns?
-Are you a nun, ma'am? -Yes, sir.
Good. Pack your things and Iet's get out of here now.
-Lieutenant! -Ma'am.
Get those weapons out of my operating room.
You're frightening my staff.
I'II be with you when I'm done. Now please wait outside!
Your staff should be frightened, ma'am.
Do you know what'II happen to you and these women when rebels get here?
Doc, maybe you can help her out.
Ma'am, may I assist?
-Are you a doctor? -No, I'm a corpsman, ma'am.
-Can you stitch? -Yes, ma'am.
-Are you sure? -Yeah, he's sure.
Then close for me.
We're taking our good old time here.
AII right, Lt. Waters, I'm aII yours.
Hurry up, Doc.
I assume you have a plan to get us aII out of here?
Yes, ma'am. Come with me, please.
We've got a 1 2-klick hike to make to rendezvous to the helicopter.
Get your things together, but pack Iight.
Zee, bring your perimeter up. Keep Flea in place.
We spotted a rebeI company outside of Yolingo on the way in.
We must assume they'II be here by night, if not sooner.
I'm responsible for 70 people here, more than half of them seriously wounded.
My orders are to evacuate foreign nationals only, ma'am.
What does that mean?
I mean nonindigenous personnel, ma'am.
Then we have a problem.
I wiII not Ieave without the indigenous personnel.
We're here to get you out.
Now, I suggest you go find the priest... ...go find the nuns, pack your things and prepare to move.
When the rebeI troops get here, they'II kiII everything they see... ...including privileged white doctors.
-What part of that plan don't you get?
-The Cameroon border's 40 miles away!
-You could fly them out in 30 minutes! -Can't do that.
-Why not? -Because my orders are very clear:
Evacuate the priest, you and the two nuns. Now pack and get ready to move.
We can take those who can walk.
They're not my responsibility. You are my responsibility.
You're right, Iieutenant... ...it's not your problem.
It is my responsibility... ...and I wiII not Ieave without my people.
AII right, give me a minute.
-A minute? -That's right.
Sixty seconds. I suggest you use that time to go find the priest.
Get Command on the horn.
Eagle One to Command.
-Lena, what's going on? -I don't know yet.
Eagle One to Command.
Eagle One.
Yeah, captain, we got a problem.
No, we got her.
But she wants to bring the 70 people here along with her.
Yes, sir, I understand.
I wiII handle it.
Eagle One, out.
Dr. Kendricks.
You win. Get your people together.  We Ieave in a half an hour.
There wiII be helicopters for them too?
Yes. We can only take those who can move under their own power.
I understand.
Thank you, Iieutenant.
Hurry, please.
Why don't we just get Doc to tranq her the fuck out?
That's a great idea, Red. Drugging and kidnapping an American doctor.
I ain't sure this bitch is American.
The doctor is the mission, Red. Stick with her.
-And we're taking aII these people out? -Go on.
-What did the captain say? -What the fuck you think he said?
Okay, Iet's clear these hooches.
Come here, you guys.
It's okay. It's okay.  Come on.
Hour and a half off the rendezvous with the bird.
-Can only bring what they carry by back. -Roger that.
-Where's that priest? -He says he ain't coming.
Bless you, Lena.
Thank you for everything.
Don't cry, Sister, please. We'II see each other again.
Take care of yourself.
-You got it, Lake? -Hundred percent, sir.
AII right. Let's go.
Take us out of here, but don't run away from us.
Roger that.
Keep them moving. Keep them moving.
Come on.
Keep them moving, Slo. Get her out of there.
Come on. Come on.  Come on.
-Come on, now. -Catch up!
Sister Grace.
-The mother? -She is dead.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
What am I going to do with this child?
Lena.
Lena, you'II have to take this child. It's the only chance she has.
We gotta move quicker than this.
We gotta get back for the Falcon game. Come on.
Take care of yourself, girl.
Sister Siobhan.
Mind yourself.
Let's go, Sister. Pick your bag up.  Let's go now.
I'm not going.
Sister!
-L.T., she doesn't want to Ieave. -I'm not going.
What?
Good Iuck.
-God bless you. -Thanks be to God.
AII right, Iet's make it quick.
Come on, ma'am, Iet's go.
Come on. We have plenty of work to do now.  Come on.
Go with God.
-God already Ieft Africa. -Yeah.
Go easy, doc. Watch your step.
I got her.
We're only five klicks in. It's seven and a half miles to LZ Alpha.
We go any slower, we'II start going backwards in time.
-Red, what do you got back there?
-Five stragglers.
-30 meters and faIling from main body. -AII right, roII them up ASAP.
Let's go.
Come on. You've gotta speed up.
Ma'am, speed up. You too.  You--
Watch those trees.
I'm gonna help you.
It's aII right. I'II teII them.
We got you.
Lieutenant.
We need to stop.
-Lieutenant! -I heard you.
We can't stop. Behind schedule.  Come on.
These people need to rest.
And we have a child who needs medication.
Here we go.
There you go, ma'am. Let's go.
Let's go, doctor.
Come on, sir. Here we go.
What you want to do?
Rest for 30.
Lake, hold it up.
We're gonna rest for 30.
Set a perimeter.
Perimeter up.
Ma'am, we gonna take 30.
L.T., we got guerriIla rebels inbound... ...on our path.
Dr. Kendricks, come with me right away. Come here.
There's danger on the trail. You must do everything you can to-- Listen to me!
You must do everything you can to keep that baby quiet, you understand me?
Whatever it takes. Go now.
Get up. Get up.
Danger close.
Go.
Clear.
Oh, fuck. L.T., straggler, straggler.  Danger close.
Go on, ma'am. Go.  Now is good.
Lake, Iead us out before they realize their tailgunner's gone.
And find us a safe place to rest.
Wait! They're going to the mission.  You have to stop them.
I can't do that. It'd risk the safety of aII these people here.
-Besides, they may bypass the mission.
-You know they won't.
There are a Iot of possible scenarios that could happen, Dr. Kendricks.
I don't presume to know them aIl. Red?
Dr. Kendricks.
-Let's go. -Ma'am.
Come on.
Can't you sleep, Iieutenant?
It's my watch, ma'am.
You can caII me Lena.
Dr. Kendricks, I suggest you get some rest.
You know....
Thank you for saving my Iife.
It wasn't about saving your Iife.
It's about getting the job done.
Completing the mission, that's aIl.
My dear... ...a thousand difficulties don't make a doubt.
-But I'm not a good Catholic.
-You don't know that. Only God knows.
Gentlemen.
Please.
This is a house of God. We have no soldiers here.
There are only sick people here.
Please, sir.
-Gentlemen, please. -No!  No!
No! Please!  Please!
-No! -No!
Commander, please. This is a house of God.
We have no soldiers here. We have hope.  We have only sick people here.
We have only sick people here.
Please.
No, commander.
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God... ...pray for us sinners now at the hour of our death.
Commander, no!
-Blessed.... -No!
Holy Mary, mother of God....
What the fuck was that?
Hyena.
Flea, Lake, status?
Clear.
Clear, L.T.
Zee?
Star One, this is Eagle One. Be advised on Iocation.
This is Star One. My E TA, your location, five minutes.
Popping smoke.
Do you have smoke?
Roger. Yellow smoke.
That's us.
Eyes on.
Slo, bring her up.
-Let's go! Come on!  Now!
Let's go now! Come on!  You're first!
Goddamn it, Iet's go! We're Iate.
Come on!
Why doesn't the other helicopter come down?!
It's a gunship! It's here to protect us!
-What about the others? -They'II be fine!  Keep moving!
You gotta move faster!
-What are you doing?! -Keep your head down!
Stand back.
-Where is she going? -Wait!  Back!
Keep your head down!
-Let us go! -Dr. Lena!
-Wait! Get back!  -Dr. Lena!
Answer me! You never planned on taking aII of us out, did you?
I simply foIlow orders! My orders are to get you out!  Get on the helicopter!
-What about my people?! -I'm not here for them.
You Iied to me!
You Iied to me!
Liar! Bastard!
Lena! Let me go!
What about my people?! I won't Ieave them!
You Iied to me!
-They're gonna die! -Secure the doctor.
Dr. Lena! Dr. Lena!
Who decides for me?! You?!
Your government?!
Bastard! I won't Ieave them!
Let's go! Let's go now!  Let's go!
Let's go! Go!  Let's go!
Lena! Lena!
Listen to me!
Listen to me! It's okay.
Let's go!
Lt. Waters. Starboard side.
We saw this on the way in.
No!
No!
No!
-Doc! -No!
Come on.
Let's turn it around.
Musa.
Patience!
Lena!
We can only take 1 2 people.
Old, young, anybody who'II slow us down.
We'II meet up again in Cameroon.
Go. And teII the others.
-God wiII bless you.
-Hurry, please.
Thank you.
Hurry, please.
Red!
Go with the package.
Now, goddamn it!
What are you doing?
New mission?
No.
Same mission.
Get them ready, Zee.
God wiII protect you. Take Mama's cross.  Take Mama's cross.
Let's go! Let's go.  Come on!
Get her out of there! Get off!
-Patience! She'II be safe.  -She's my baby!
Keep your head down.
She has no one to care for her.
Ma'am, you gotta take this baby!
Hold her tight!
-Keep your heads down! -No more packs, sir.  We're maxed out.
See you in Cameroon.
Come on. Let's go.
Here we go. Stay Iow.
Head down.
Let's go.
Sergeant! Let's go!
Eagle One, over.
Can you wait one, sir?
A.K.
Command.
Yes, sir?
Lieutenant, why is that bird fuII of refugees and not your criticals?
The doctor wouldn't Ieave her people.
You can't get a woman on a helo?
She was on the bird.
-It's difficult to explain, sir. -Oh, come on.
We're marching them to LZ Bravo. Request helicopters to take them out.
Negative on the evac at LZ Bravo.
Come on, give me three choppers. I'II have them in Cameroon in 20 minutes.
Negative!
Birds have taken heavy fire. We've stopped entering Nigerian airspace.
We'll give you what help we can from our end, but right now... ...you are on your own.
Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
Me too, sir.
AII right. We'II keep you advised if the situation changes.
Negative on the evac.
Come on. There you go.  Come on.
Hang on to the knot, doctor.
-Come on. -We got you.
Come on. Come on, doc.
Americans.
Some went in the helicopter.
Some went up the mountain... ...to Cameroon.
Slo.
Give me your chow, man.
I don't Iike roast beef anyway.
We're a Iittle over 30 klicks to the path to Cameroon.
Roger that.
What do you got?
We got a Iarge body 1 0 klicks back, bearing 3-6-0 and closing.
How strong?
Thirty, maybe platoon strength, maybe more.
Rebels?
Could be.
Why would anybody be foIlowing us?
I don't know.
But we're gonna find out.
Good job.
-Keep an eye on them. -Roger that.
-Sir? -We got a problem.
We got possible hostiles on our 6.
Get them up, get them ready to move.
Roger that.
Dr. Kendricks, could you come with me, please?
Thank you. It'II just take a second.
-Do you know why anybody'd foIlow us? -No, I don't.
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
-Think hard. -I told you, I don't know.
Get your people ready to go now.
These people have been going for over 30 hours.
Red, help the doctor get ready to move.
How you doing?
The fuck you mean, how am I doing?
You know what I'm talking about.
You know as weII as I do... ...that when we Ieft that mission, those people were dead.
And then we take 28 men, women and children... ...and we hump for a day.
Zee, keep them moving.
Be with you in a second.
We get them to the LZ, and we Ieave them behind to die Iike the others.
I'm confused.
And the boys are confused.
Get to the point.
Why'd you turn that bird around, L.T.?
Talk to me.
I'm with you either way. You know that.
When I figure it out, I'II Iet you know.
This way.
-L.T. -Go, Lake.
You're gonna want to come take a look at this.
Get Dr. Kendricks up here. Come here.
We'II rest here for a minute. Stay down in these trees.  Listen to my men.
Slo.
Stay down. Stay down.
Zee, Flea, with me.
What do you got?
Ringside seats to an ethnic cleansing.
How strong?
I counted seven so far, sir.
-Flea, get eyes on. -Roger that.
There could be more in the hooches.
Bring them up.
Sir, we could go around them to the north.
L.T.
Rules of engagement.
We're already engaged.
Hand me the binoculars.
Flea, you got the Zippo?
Roger that.
Zippo first.
Red Team, right flank. This way.  Edge of clearing.
Silent and quick. Gold Team, on me.
Silk, close up that back door.
-Flea, keep your eye on the package. -Roger that.
Holding.
Let's go.
On-site.
Goddamn.
Been going at it aII day.
-On-site. -Roger that.
Go!
It's okay. I'm here to help you.
I'II help you. It's okay.
Atkins!
Hide!
Go! Run!  Get out of here!
-Doc, get them out of here! -Move!
Go! Go!
Hold on. You hold on.
Come on, Iittle man, come on.
Boss, you want me to take a Iook at that?
I'm aII right.
It's a kid. It's only a fucking kid.
Motherfucker. Get the fuck up.
Look at your work, motherfucker.
Lake.
Doc, get over here.
Red.
Her baby's dead.
Zee.
EternaI rest grant unto her, oh, Lord. Let perpetuaI Iight shine on her.
May her souI and the souls of aII the dead rest in peace.
EternaI rest grant unto her, oh, Lord. Let perpetuaI Iight shine on her.
EternaI rest grant unto her, oh, Lord. Let perpetuaI Iight shine on her.
May her souI and the souls of aII the dead rest in peace.
She has a Iow pulse.
How can they do this?
This is what they do.
They cut off the breasts of nursing mothers... ...so that they'II never again feed their own babies.
This is what they do.
Doc.
I need morphine.
Dr. Kendricks.
Dr. Kendricks.
It's aII right.
-Is something wrong? -Let me take care of your arm.
AII right.
Careful.
Try this.
It wiII help you stay awake.
What is it?
Cola nut from the tree.
It's harmless.
We've been using them for generations.
Patience, right?
How Iong you been at the mission?
I Iive there.
I've been Iiving there since I was 1 0.
How come?
I heard they were helping children who had been forced into the war... ...so I ran to them.
WiII you get me to my daughter?
Yes, ma'am.
How'd you end up here in Africa?
I came here with my husband.
We wanted to help.
We went to Sierra Leone. They were short of doctors there.
How did your husband die?
We were at the hospital.
The rebels came.
My husband tried to stop them, to protect me... ...but he couldn't.
I'm sorry.
You did a good thing today.
I don't know if it was a good thing or not.
Feels Iike so Iong since I've done... ...a good thing, the right thing.
You should have some rest.
Thank you for taking care of my arm.
Easy, boss.
-Are we there yet?
-Glad to see you stiII got it... ...but we got trouble.
You aII right?
What do you got?
This is the outfit that's been on our tail.
-Hey. You with me, boss?  -Yeah.
-This is at 2200 hours. -Yeah.
Four hours ago.
Three hours.
We figured they'd make camp and come at us after first Iight, right?
Bad caIl.
Two hours ago.
One.
These guys run the damned Olympics. They've been closing in on us aII night.
How Iong we got?
An hour, two tops.
We shouldn't have stopped.
How the fuck are they tracking us at night?
Someone's transmitting something.
Zee.
We got a rat in the nest. Get them up.
Take their weapons away. We search everybody right now.
-Okay, team. -Dr. Kendricks.
-Turn two. -Lena.  Get up.
Everybody, up.
Point out everybody that came into the mission in the Iast three days.
-Right now. -Let's see the weapons.
Give me your weapons.
-Gideon. -Let's go.  Step forward, sir.
Who else?
Who else?!
These people.
-Step forward, you two, right now. -On your knees.
L.T.!
Down! Now!
Silk.
No!
-Hey! What the heII are you doing?  -He's my friend!
You know what? He could also be armed.
Get back there with the others! Go on!
-Watch his hands. -Fuck.
Shit.
What the heII is that?
What do you got?
He's bugged.
You fuck!
-Stop it! -Who told you to do this?
-They have my family.
-Who told you to do it?!
-They have my family.
-Who has your family?!
I was promised no harm wiII come to them.
-Who told you to do it?! -Stop it!
-Who told you to do it?! -Col. Sadick.
Col. Sadick.
I am one of many who give him information.
About who? Information about who?!
We have to foIlow....
Who?! Who?!
We have to foIlow....
-FoIlow who?! -Arthur.
Arthur?
I am not a kiIler.
The fuck you're not.
-What do you wanna do with him? -Let him bleed out.
Why?
What is going to happen to my family?
I don't know.
-Help them. -Zee.  Lake.
-Get them up. -Everybody up.
Who knows what this is?
This is a transmitter.
I took this off Gideon's dead body... ...Dr. Kendricks' good friend.
You have any more of these here?
Why would anybody wanna transmit our position?
Transmit our position to over 300 Nigerian soldiers... ...who ran aII night... ...to get to within an hour and a half of where we are now?
Red.
Somebody's gonna teII me.
Somebody's gonna start talking right now.
Because if they don't teII me what I want to know... ...by the time I count to five... ...I'm gonna kiII someone else.
One.
Two.
Three.
Don't fuck with me.
-Four. -Please.
Please.
There's no need for this.
Please.
Now you got something to say to me, don't you?
My name is Arthur Azuka.
I'm the only son of President SamueI Azuka.
Please don't blame them.
Please.
I'm sorry to have misled you... ...but there are enemies Iooking for me everywhere.
That is why you're being pursued.
Our report said the entire presidentiaI family was executed.
Your reports were incorrect.
They were not executed.
They murdered my father... ...along with my mother... ...and my two... ...younger sisters... ...out of greed... ...and my father's fight for democracy for his people.
My people.
When it first appeared there might be trouble... ...my father sent me away with this man.
Col. Okeze.
Lieutenant, his father was more than the president.
He was the tribaI king.
That makes him the heir to the Ibo nation.
It's a bloodline they must cut.
The Fulanis wiII comb heaven and earth to find him.
You knew about this?
You knew aII the time, and you didn't teII me.
I didn't trust you... ...at the time.
I wonder what it takes to earn your trust.
Red, Lake.
TeII them to pack their things. We're Ieaving.
Men, give them their weapons. We're moving out of here.
-Pack up your things. -Come on.
Move it out!
-Get in, get out. Okay?  -Come on.
Move it. Move it.
-Come on. See you.  Hurry back.
They must continue their route to the Tandjile Pass or they'II Iose a day.
So they must come out here, near the Cameroon border.
No!
How many men do you have in Gashanka?
Right on time.
Good hustle, Red. Come on up and brief Zee.
This river wiII get us straight into Cameroon.
They'II be expecting us.
What do you think?
I think we're fucked either way we go.
We backtrack, cross downstream... ...come up, go through the jungle and rip right into Cameroon.
Roger that. Let the other men know.
-Yes, sir. -Good job.
L.T.
-What do you got? -Rhodes on the phone.
Yes, sir, captain, this is Waters.
InteI reports military elements in your sector... ...conducting search and destroy of a U.S. military unit... ...moving with Arthur Azuka, son of the Iate president.
What can you teII me? Yes, sir, we just discovered that ourselves.
He and his bodyguard hid themselves within Dr. Kendricks' refugee party.
That's a major problem, Iieutenant.
He involves your mission in the internal politics of a foreign nation... ...affecting U.S. diplomacy and seriously increases the mission's risk.
He's considered a criminaI by the new regime.
He's a major Iiability.
-What exactly does that mean, sir? -His party is excess cargo.
You mean he's not human, sir?
Captain, this man is the Ibo tribaI Ieader. Do you know what that means?
Cut the shit. Who do you think I am?
Sir, we both know what'II happen to him if I Ieave him out here.
There won't be a trial or a jury.
Outside the courthouse, they'II put two in his head.
I'm just asking for a Iittle help here. Put yourself in my shoes, BiIl.
I've been in your shoes, Iieutenant.
Send in an air evac immediately and get aII of us out of here, sir.
Negative on air support at this time. Airspace is too hot.
Your judgment has risked the lives of your men and the mission's success.
I advise you, complete the evacuation as planned! Do you read me?!
Yes, sir, I read you. Loud and clear.
But I cannot, in good conscience, do that without taking these people to safety.
That's not your mission!
When have I not completed a mission?
My team wiII complete this mission.
I give you my word on that.
I don't Iike this.
Get your ass back here alive soon as possible.
Maintain contact with OP center.
I'II direct air support as soon as I can.
I promise you.
Yes, sir.
Eagle One, out.
Bring them up.
Everybody up on L.T. now. Double time.
So much for diplomacy.
Come on, Iet's go.
Here's the deal.
It's been strongly suggested that we turn over Arthur... ...and abandon these refugees out here in the bush.
I'II teII you right now I'm not gonna do that.
I can't do that.
I broke my own rule.
I started to give a fuck... ...and brought you guys along with me.
We're about to walk into some serious shit.
Before we do, I'd just Iike... ...to hear what you guys have to say about it. That's aIl.  Speak freely.
In my opinion, sir... ...we cut our Iosses.
As far as me being in or out... ...you know the answer to that.
Let's get these people to safety.
Let's finish the job.
I can't Ieave them, sir.
I'm good to go.
What about you, Red?
I can't Iook at them Iike packages anymore.
I'm gonna get them out... ...or I'm going to die trying.
Are we there yet?
Thanks, feIlas.
Strip those packs down to roIling gear only.
Have the refugees drop anything that don't go "boom." Let's move.
Double time. Let's go.  Hustle.
L.T... ...those Africans are my people too.
For aII the years that we were told to stand down and to stand by... ...you're doing the right thing.
For our sins.
We gotta go.
Let's go.
Lieutenant.
I'm sorry I didn't teII you about Arthur.
I should have trusted you.
It's not your fault.
I would've done the same thing if I was in your position.
I wouldn't have trusted me either.
I'm gonna get your people to Cameroon.
I promise. Come on.  We gotta hurry.
L.T., hold one.
Hold one.
What do you got, Lake?
Everybody down. Get down!  Get down!
Where you at, motherfuckers?
Where you at?
Fat fuck.
Look at this motherfucker.
Pussy.
Clear, L.T. It's just a pig.
I'm crossing over.
Sniper, 1 1 o'clock.
Sniper, 1 1 o'clock.
-Zee! -Smoke!  Give me smoke!
L.T... ...I got hit.
-Look who it is. The fucking cavalry.  -Keep your hand on that.
-Sit him up. -How's he doing?
He's aII right. One in the shoulder.
Clean hit. Sorry, sir.  He caught me sleeping.
Don't worry about it.
-Did you get that Iittle son of a bitch? -We got some of him.
-You see anybody else?
-Sorry. -I'm better than that, sir.
-Don't worry. I'm better than that.
-Fuck that. -Can you walk?
Yes, sir.
Let's go, Doc. Make it tight.  Get me back in this shit.
AII right. Ready.
Get down!
Grenade!
Dr. Kendricks!
Lena!
Lena!
Lena, Iisten. Wake up.
Wake up. Oh, God.  Wake up.
Do you hear me? Okeze!  Okeze!
Wake up.
Okeze.
Lena, Iisten to me.
We've gotta get out of here now! You hear me?
Listen, we gotta get out of here. We gotta get out of here right now.
Slo, Zee, get them ready to go now!
Sit up.
Slo!
Slo!
-Oh, fuck! Goddamn it!  -Fuck.
I never saw it coming, boss.
It wasn't supposed to happen Iike this.
It's my fault. It's my fault, aII right?
Breathe.
-You know what to do, right?
-Yeah. Yeah, I know what to do.
You hear me? I got it, okay?
Breathe. Just relax.
You'II get them there, right? It's not for nothing, right?
Right? I'II get them there.  Don't worry.
I got it. I got everything, aII right?  Don't worry.
Breathe, Slo. Breathe, breathe.
I guess we're there, huh, boss?
Yeah, we're there.
Zee, get these people ready to go. Do it now.
Silk... ...get his weapons and ammunition.
What about the body?
We gotta come back for it.
Goddamn it.
-No. -Listen to me, goddamn it!  Listen to me!
This man is dead.
If you don't want his death to be meaningless... ...it's time for you to become a man and get your people into Cameroon!
Now cowboy the fuck up! You got it?
Do you understand me?
-Yes, sir. -Good.
-You aII right?
-Yes, sir. -Stay with this man.
-Yes, sir. It's your job to keep him alive!
Everybody down! It's your job to keep him alive!  Everybody down!
Get down! Stay down!
Open up those toolboxes, boys. They'II be coming!
Conserve your ammo!
Get down!
-Red, how many claymores you got?
Stand by to Iay down cover fire for Red. On my mark!
And now!
Everybody down!
Command, this is Eagle One!
Under hostile enemy attack! Request immediate air support!
Location: one klick south of Tandjile Pass.
Launch!
I say again, request immediate air support.
Location: one klick south of Tandjile Pass. Come back!
Grenades!
Stand by to peel! Zee, get them out of here now!
You have to run! Do not stop tiII you hit the trees.
-Come on! -Let's go!  Let's go!
Move it! Go!
Move! Now!
Go! -Let's go!  Come on!
Dr. Kendricks, keep your head down! Let's go!  Dr. Kendricks, keep your head down!

-Yes. -Get ready to go.
You okay? You okay?
Help me get her up. Help me get her up!
Fuck you!
Go! Go!
-Bound! -Bounding.
-Move out! -Go!  Go now!
-Go! -Move, Zee!
Damn it!
Get that knife off me.
Tie it around my Ieg. Tight!
You guys are gonna have to help me.
Eagle One, this is Star One. Do you read me?  Come in.
Go! Go!  Go!
Run! -Run straight for that gate!  -We have to go!
We have to go! Dr. Kendricks, Iet's go!
Forward! Come on!
Hang on! Hang on!  We're here.
We're at the border. The gate's right over there!
Excuse me, Iet us through.
Please. Let us through.
Please!
Let us through! Open the gates!
Please open the gates! Please!
-Coming in!
Doc, check him out.
-How's he doing? -Got a Iow pulse.
Eagle One, this is Star One. Eagle One, this is Star One.  Do you read?
Star One, this is Eagle One.
Go! What do you got down there, L.T.?
I got beaucoup bad guys between the tree Iine and my smoke!
Doc, pop smoke now!
-Where's Silk and Red? -Silk's dead.
I don't think Red made it either. You stay with me, Zee.
Zee, you stay with me. Stay with me.
You have to help these people! I'm an American!
I got white smoke, L.T.
Let her rip, Todd. Danger close!
Roger that. Coming in hot.
Oh, my God.
Red! Red!  Come on, Red!
Come on! Move it!  Forward!
Come on! Red, come on!
Get down! Get your head down.
Cover!
Keep Zee moving.
-Arthur, help me. -Lieutenant.  You're okay.
-We made it. -Yes, we made it.
You made it.
Lieutenant. Lieutenant.
We made it.
I'm sorry about your men.
I wiII never forget you.
God--
God wiII never forget you, Iieutenant.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Take care.
Open up! Open up!  Open up!
Open the gate. Open the gate.
Welcome back, Iieutenant.
This is Dr. Lena Kendricks, captain.
This is Arthur Azuka... ...son of the Iate President SamueI Azuka.
-I have men down in the field, sir.
-We'II take care of them.
-The doctor needs medicaI attention.
-So do you. Get them in here.
-My men also....
-Take care of them.
-Let's go. Come on!  Move.
-Over here! -Come on.  Zee, come on.
You made it. You made it.
Amaka!
Amaka!
Mama!
Amaka!
Lena! Lena!  Lena!
Lena! Lena!
We love you, Lena.
AII of us.
We wiII always love you.
I love you too.
Move him in.
Freedom!
Hello, fence. Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky. Get off my lawn!
Trespasser.
Do you want to be eaten alive?
- No. - Then get out of here!  My trike.
Stay away from my house! - DJ!
- We're gonna be late.
Yeah, Mom, I'm coming. I'm coming.
October 30th: another tricycle.
I'm coming. Mom.
Mom, he did it again. He took another tricycle.
Okay, honey, we've talked about this.
You cannot stay up in your room all day... ...staring at an old man through a telescope.
But, Mom, there's something wrong with that house.
I'm serious.
What was that?
I'm serious.
His voice sounds funny.
Someone is hitting puberty.
"What's happening to my body?" Right, buddy?
Maybe you should come with us.
Oh, the boy's too busy. He's got his spying to do.
I'm not spying.
Well...
"Well..." That's okay, buddy.
When I was your age, I did exactly the same thing.
Of course, it was with binoculars and involved the lovely Jensen twins.
Neither of which was as lovely as your beautiful mother.
Will you be an angel and help me bring out the incisor?
- The incisor. - Hold this.
Yeah, you don't wanna forget that. Elizabeth will be here in a few hours.
If anything happens, call the police and hide.
He knows that.
See you tomorrow night.
- What have you done? - Just let me drive this thing, will you?
- Where is DJ? Where's DJ?  - I'm fine.
You would be so happy if he was under the car, wouldn't you?
Sorry. It's hard to see with the mask on.
Then why don't you keep it off, Chowder?
Why did you put up your window?
- Chowder. - It's aerodynamic.
- Hi, DJ. - We've got to make time.  The children.
The children. - What children?  - Bye-bye, baby.
- Tell him you love him, dear. - He knows that.
- Tell your son you love him. - I don't wanna tell him.
- He knows I love him. - He's your son.
- You have to say it. Roll it down.  - We're gonna be late.
We both love you.
- That includes your dad. - That's right.  - He's had enough kisses.
- Blow him a kiss.
- Blow him a kiss. - Goodbye.  Cheer up.
It's almost Halloween.
In one day and three hours, it's candy time. Okay?
- Check it out, I got a new ball. - Cool.
Oh, speaking of which, have you decided?
Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?
Chowder.
I don't think I'm going trick-or-treating this year.
What?
Come on, you're gonna break a six-year streak.
Yeah, six years of being jumped and egged.
Maybe I'm getting too grown-up. Three seconds on the clock.
I'm playing basketball. It's time for an in-your-face disgrace.
- Are you okay? - My nose is in my brains.
Let me see. Oh, my God.
- What? - You're a dork.
Where's my ball? Oh, no.
- Sorry, man. - Wait, wait.  DJ.
You're a grownup now, you go get it.
Chowder, your ball just landed on Nebbercracker's lawn.
It doesn't exist anymore. I paid $28 for that ball.
I raked 10 yards and asked my mom for a dollar 26 times.
I never worked that hard in my life...
Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.
- So? - So maybe he's sleeping.
All right, I'll do it.
I'll never forget this. Hurry, though.  Go.
You.
- No. - DJ, run!  Get the ball and run!
You're so close.
What have you done?
- Just nudge it over here. - I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so, so, so sorry. I didn't mean...
You are dead.
DJ, come on, come on! - Chowder.
- Come on, DJ.
Help. Chowder.
Help. Help.
- You think you can terrorize my lawn? - No, I'm sorry.
- You wanna be a dead person? - No.  I love life.
This place is not a playground for children.
- Got it from now on. - This is my house!
Why can't you respect that?
Why can't you just stay away from...? Push.
No siren. Never a good sign.  I'm a murderer.
- No, you're not. - I'm not?
When it's an accident, they call it manslaughter.
I think I'm gonna throw up. Great.
Babysitter's here.
See you, DJ.
Perfect. DJ.
Hey, DJ, I just saw an ambulance. Did I miss anything interesting?  Hello?
Elizabeth... ...can I talk to you about something?
Oh, yeah, of course you can, cantaloupe.
We are gonna have the bestest time.
- Got tons of neat activities planned. - They already left.
- They did? They're gone?  - Yes, and I need to talk to you.
So the usual deal: indoors by 9, in your room by 11.
- Lights out, your call. - Elizabeth.
- And it's Zee. - "Zee"?
Now, listen up. I control the TV, the stereo and the phone.
I don't do board games, Shrinky Dinks or tuck-ins.
I'm not your mother. I'm not your friend.
Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay? I am practically a grownup.
I don't even need you here, Elizabeth. - Gosh, DJ, why'd you break that?
- But I didn't.
Yeah, let me ask you something. Who are they gonna believe?
- Go to your room. - Fine.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, very funny. See how you like it.  Happy Halloween, doofus.
Nice one, Bones.
Look at his face. That's funny.
You're not supposed to have friends over. Who's this?
- This is Bones. - What's up?
- He's in a band. - That's right.
And, anyway, cantaloupe, let's not open up the rulebook, okay?
Since you're up way past your bedtime.
No, no, no, this is different. Listen.  You called the neighbors.
Good for you.
I used star-69. He called me.
- Who called you? - Nebbercracker.
P.S., he died today.
- You lie. - Do not.
He died, and now I'm getting phone calls from his house.
A phone call from beyond the grave. Guys, come on.
I'm serious.
Oh, he's serious. Did you know he was serious?
- Come on, man, give her back. - Oh, "her"?  You mind?
Oh, come on. Gross.
- Come on, Bones. - Wait, hold on, dude.  Ith...
She's having trouble breathing. Might have something in her throat.
All right, I'll look into it.
- No. Elizabeth.  No.
Downstairs, now.
Sorry, kid, can't play anymore.
You are so funny.
I know. It's like I don't even try and it just happens.  God, stop doing this.
Oh, yeah? What you gonna do?  - Homicide.
- Chowder, where are your parents?
My dad's at the pharmacy... ...and my mom's at the movies with her personal trainer.
- Meet me at the Danger Zone now. - Fine.
- Bones, I said, knock it off. - Come on, man.
No, I'm creeped out.
You know, I saw an ambulance here today.
So?
So maybe Nebbercracker really did die.
We should be so lucky. The guy is evil.
No, he's just a crotchety old dude.
Oh, really, Zee?
When I was 10 years old, I had a kite. Awesome kite.
I could fly it so high you couldn't see it.
One day, it crashed down.
I followed the string and it ended right over there... ...across the street, right at the edge of his lawn.
Did he take your kite?
Yeah, he takes whatever lands on his lawn.
But that's not the point.
The point is, is that I saw him talking to his house... ...and kissing it.
Besides... ...everybody knows what he did to his wife.
Why? What...?  What did he do to her?
- He ate her. - Bones.  Get off.
- Bones, enough. - Come on, Zee.
Bones, I'm so sick of you.
- I was just... - You have no respect for women.
What? What does that mean?
Get out.
Fine. Prude.
What are you looking at?
Nebbercracker. You really are dead, aren't you?
I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker.
What are you gonna do about it, Nebbercracker?
Nebber-snapper-flipper-dipper... My awesome kite.
Chowder. Chowder.
Chowder?
Chowder. Heat seeker.
Chowder, what are you doing? Shut up.
What?
Nebbercracker's back from the dead.
- No way. - Yeah.
They leave the keys in here. You dare me?
Chowder, you're not listening to me.
Nebbercracker's haunting me, all right? His blood is on my hands.
And now he's coming back for revenge.
You're really crazy right now. Have you noticed that?
I think you're just freaking out because you killed a guy today.
Life goes on.
For you.
Try and relax. Be cool, like me.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Make it stop.
Quit screwing around.
I need your help.
Fine. You want my help?
- Yeah. - I got three words for you:
"Trick or treat." Okay.
Whatever. Let's go.  Hold on.
Chowder, come on. The haunting is subtle... ...yet really, really boring.
- Can I go home now? - Chowder, he'll hear you.
DJ... ...this is why nobody will sit next to us at lunch.
I'll go Ding Dong Ditch the house and you'll see. No ghost.
Chowder, stop, please.
Chowder, I'm serious.
Chowder, come back. Come back here, please, Chowder.
Come on. Chowder.  Come back.
- Oh, no. A bottle.  - Chowder, put that down.
- Come back, please. - Bottle.  Hey, DJ, who am I?
Get off my lawn.
Don't. Come on.  Run.
Chowder, get out of there.
- Chowder, come here. - Mommy.
This way. This way.
Help. Come on, Chowder!  Chowder, this way!
Don't look back. I looked back.
Bones?
Coming.
Don't even think about crawling back here...
Trick or treat. What?
Good morning, ma'am.
You witnessed a simulation of what you'll face this evening.
Studies show that households that run out of candy... ...are 55 percent more likely to be TP'd.
To help avert this tragedy... ...I'm here selling Halloween candy for my school, Westbrook Prep.
Good school. I got kicked out of there.
Now, what do you want?
Just trying to get a head start on life and secure a successful future.
You want a successful future?
When a guy with tattoos comes up to the drive-through... ...give him his burger, not your phone number.
Thank you for the advice. I'll be sure to make a note of it.
But back to business. Eggs, shaving cream, toilet paper.
Without candy, I'm afraid your house is a bull's-eye with shingles.
Nice try. It's not my house.
Babysitter?
Okay, let's cut the crap.
Maybe the parents you work for left you $40 in emergency money.
Maybe they left me 30.
Maybe you give me 20, I write a receipt for 30 and you pocket 10.
Maybe.
And I want two extra bags of peanut clusters.
One bag and I'll toss in a licorice whip.
You're good. Eight A.M. No detectable movement.
No detectable movement.
Hey, DJ, I brought you some chocolate. Cover blown?
No detectable movement.
What are you two weirdoes up to?
Oh, nothing.
Just something in the house across the street just tried to eat us.
Yeah. We've been watching all night.  We haven't even left this room once.
Not even to go to the bathroom. Don't drink that.
Oh, gross.
Whatever disease you guys have... ...I'm sure it's got letters and that they make pills for it.
Zee, it's true. There's something evil going on across the street.
That's excellent. I'm really happy for you.
Anyway, have you two astronomers seen Bones?
He left last night unexpectedly... ...and he never came back.
Never came back? - Bottle.
- Of course.
Oh, okay, you know what? I don't have time for this.
Listen, Zee, I don't know how to tell you this...
Your boyfriend has most likely been eaten alive.
Sherry Klausen.
I gotta go.
Breakfast.
Happy Halloween, losers. Hello.
What?
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
Let me see. - Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- No. No.  Hey.
DJ, that's your phone.
- No, stop. - Girl.  Hey.
- Don't go in there. - Hold it.
Don't go any further.
- Come here. - Yes, over here.
Are you guys mentally challenged?
If you are, I'm certified to teach you baseball.
Detectable movement. - What do we do?
What do we do? - Come on.  Guys.
- Run, Chowder. - I'm running.
Help, please. - Got her.
- No, I got her.
Hello? - Hey.
- Oh, my God.
There's an angry dad on the phone looking for the one called Chowder. Hello?
Losers, I'm talking to you. He's worried about you.
He should be.
- Start explaining. - All right, the house, it tried to eat us.
- Stop explaining, I've had enough. - Wait, wait, where are you going?
To see what's happening with that stupid house of yours.
- No, no, no. You can't.  - What is your problem?
Puberty. Yeah, I'm having lots and lots of puberty.  - No more Mountain Dew.
- Right.
I'm going to find Bones.
All right, you have fun. Don't worry about us, we'll be fine.
And you tell him I said hey, okay? Safe driving.
See you. Oh, hi.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
Oh, yeah. I made the whole puberty thing up.
Hi, I'm JD. DJ.
Yes, Dad, I meant to call you, but I forgot.
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay.
Absolutely.
Affirmative.
- Okay, love you. Bye.  - Yeah.
And this is our little observation post... ...such as it were.
Yeah, posters are stupid.
I was gonna tear them down and put up some art.
Well, Dad, why don't you kiss my hairy butt?
Hey, DJ, you got any beer?
Well, hello there.
This is Chowder.
Charles, to the ladies.
Jenny Bennett.
Two-term class president at Westbrook Prep.
- That's a tough school to get into. - Yeah, I got in, but decided not to go.
It's a girls' school.
Which is why I didn't.
You know, there's a... There's a great taco stand near there.
I hate Mexican food.
- Me too. - Me too.  Fascinating, isn't it?
Just sits there waiting... ...mocking us with its... ...houseness.
- May I please use your phone? - Yeah, sure.
Here. Who you calling?
- My mother. - Rude.
She's probably not gonna believe you.
It's too much for the adult mind to comprehend. Is this pee?
Because if it is, that's really gross.
- It's... - DJ?
You pee in bottles?
What are you talking about? That one's your pee.
- It's yours. - It's his.
- May I speak with Allison? - Unsanitary.
- Her daughter. Thank you.  - It's his pee.
Excuse me.
I was selling chocolates in Mayville, and, well, it's kind of confusing.
So you hate Mexican food, huh?
Yeah. You too, huh?
Yeah, in fact, you might say I started hating it first.
Outside in front of the house?
- Fine. Let's get technical.  - Okay.
I started hating it through the telescope.
Can't call dibs on a girl through a telescope.
You can't call dibs on a girl.
- Just did. - Me too.
She didn't believe me.
Authority can be so: Okay.
Normally I don't spend time with guys like you.
But a house just tried to eat me, so you've got one hour. Oh, a puppy.
Didn't see that coming.
Okay... ...I think it's time to call the police.
Do you realize what's gonna happen tonight?
Hundreds of kids walking right up to that house.
Wait, wait, wait. Come on.  Guys, I think we're overreacting.
Think about it.
Only a total moron would walk up to old man Nebbercracker's house. - Hey, my ball.
- Chowder.
No. It's gonna be a bloodbath.
Good news. The cops are here.
All right, kids, this better be good.
I was in the forest wrestling with a bear claw when we got the call. I was eating a doughnut.
All three of you, step to the car now.
- My ears. - They're at the car.
He's a rookie. First week on the job.
Officer, we have reason to believe... ...there's a dangerous creature inside that house.
- It may have killed a man. - And a dog.
Doggy down? We've got a situation.
- We've got a situation. - What are you doing?
Calling for backup. Didn't you hear the kid?
There's a dangerous creature inside that house.
We don't have backup. It's just Judy at the station.
And this is no situation.
It's just a couple Tater Tots hopped up on too many Pixy Stix.
I bet you the dead dog would beg to differ.
What was that?
Nothing. All right.
Time's up, peewees.
- It's Halloween. We got things to do.  - We do?
No, wait, you can't.
All right, this thing, it has a mouth... ...and it comes out and grabs things and pulls them in and eats them.
Yeah, like this:
Okay, okay, okay.
The thing is... ...we're trying to make this sound more real than it normally would.
Problem is it sounds kind of not real.
- So we'll see you later. - No.
All right. I'll show you.  But if things get out of hand...
We'll aim for Bigfoot.
That's loaded. He's hopping.
Smart house. Hey.
You... Both of you.  Come here.
Bring it to the car.
Come on.
I'm gonna forget you throwing that rock because that dance was pretty funny.
But next time any of you mess with this guy's house... ...all three of you are going in the hole, you got it?
Now, I'll give you 10 seconds to march.
But we need your help.
It's your job to help us.
- One.
- Come on.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
That's tender.
My house is right over there.
So much for relying on the government.
Yeah, I know. I hate the government.
- Dude, we're screwed. - No, we're not.
We'll go to an expert.
You're looking at the three-time, tri-state... ...over-14 "Thou Art Dead" champion.
His name is Reginald Skulinski. But they call him Skull.
- Who's "they"? - Me and DJ.
- Yeah. - He's the smartest guy on earth.
So let's go talk to him.
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny. - Hey, Jenny, Jenny, hold on.  Hold up.
Skull is in the game zone right now.
You don't wanna mess with him when he's in the game zone.
Fine, so how long is he gonna be playing?
Die. Die.
Who knows?
He once played for four days straight... ...on one quarter, a gallon of chocolate milk and an adult diaper.
The man's a legend.
Well, if he's not coming out of the game zone, then we are going in.
- What? Hey, what are you...?  - What?
It's like you're not gonna... You're not gonna do it.  Like...
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.  Watch out.
Did you see that? I just chopped off your head again.
Your head's rolling. You can't see it, your eyes are on your head.
- Sir?
- What?
I'm busy playing a video game without even looking at the screen.
What?
Old man Nebbercracker's house is possessed.
I need to know how to destroy it before it kills people.
Calm down. You make me wanna throw up in some tinfoil and eat it.
Oh, you like the steel of my blade? It's so cold.  Possessed house, you say?
In my travels to the video store and comic-book conventions... ...I've seen many strange and wondrous things.
And I've heard tell of man-made structures... ...becoming possessed by a human soul... ...so that the spirit becomes merged with wood and brick... ...creating a rare form of monster... ...known as Domus mactabilis.
The house is Mr. Nebbercracker.
We're its murderous enemies.
Have fun getting killed. Run, coward.
Look at that blood.
So how do we kill it?
You've gotta strike at the source of life: the heart.
But houses don't have hearts.
Yes! Oh, yeah.
Yeah. You might be right about that.
Sorry, children, but I've got some very important business to take care of.
I won't be seeing you later. Thou art dead.
So we need to strike at the heart.
Yeah, but where are we gonna find a heart inside a house?
Ever since Nebbercracker died... ...there's been smoke coming out of that chimney.
The furnace. The furnace is the heart.
If we wanna put out the fire, we're gonna have to go inside.
Without getting chewed to pieces.
- Dummy. - Hey, I was just doodling.
No, Chowder, this is it. First, we build a dummy.
We fill the dummy with a few gallons of cold medicine.
- Borrow it from your dad's pharmacy. - Say what?
Feed the dummy to the house, house eats the medicine, goes to sleep.
- Look at this. - We get in, douse the fire and get out.  - Questions?
- Yes, are you nuts?
I don't wanna steal drugs from my father... ...I don't wanna go inside a monster and I don't wanna die.
- I say it's worth a shot. - Yes, I agree, let's do it.
Hey, but I wanted that one.
- You've gotta be kidding me. - Yes.  - Chowder.
Quiet. - Sorry.  Go.
Whoopsie-daisy. All right, little vacuum-cleaner dummy, I'm gonna move you into position.
You don't be scared.
That's not how I trained you.
I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.
Chowder, come on. Okay.  Yes.
Trick or treat.
Plug it in. So close.
Littering, loitering, vandalism, vagrancy...
- And treason. - No, not treason.
- You sure? Because in the book...
- I'm sure.
All right, kids, out of the trash cans. Let's go.
Come on. You heard the big guy.  You see the light.
Come on, keep it moving.
All right, drop your weapons.
Pass them to me. Come on.
- I will shoot you. - Well, lookie we got here.  You stay here, I'm checking this out.
I am on it. Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me? Huh, tough girl?
You disrespecting the badge?
You don't want none of this. I'm telling you.  Test me.
Y'all wanna test me?
I am the police. I know you're a thug.
Them brown eyes...
I see it in your eyes.
That's it. That is it.
You got something to say, Porky, huh?
- That's it, we're taking them in. - That's what I'm talking about.
- Where we taking them? - To jail.  Let's go.
You hear that? You guys are going to jail.
But, officer, you've gotta believe us.
Yeah, 2-percent, you got the right to shut up.
- Okay, the house is a monster. - And to think I believed you.
Hey, listen, I'm with you guys. My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.
I mean, kind of a cop. He has a gun.
Yeah. They're gonna love you downtown, Jughead.  We are supercops.
Yeah. That's why I live in a condo.
Supercop. Super-duper-duper-cop.  Super...
- You hear that? - That's my stomach.  I'm starving.
No, no. That sounds like the dangerous creature.
- I'm gonna go check it out. - Oh, my gosh.
This is like trying to wrangle a puppy. All right, I'll be back.
- You guys, stop. - Hey, guys.
- No. Get out of there.  - No, don't go in there.
What? I tell you.
Super-roll. - Stop.
Stop. - Hey.  Hey.
Where you at, spooky creature?
I'm gonna find you. Freeze... ...tree.
Hey, what you doing? You can't do that.
Not to an officer, brother. That is illegal.  - I'm coming, buddy.
- Put me down!
- I'm gonna go get backup. - I thought there was no backup.
I'm getting Judy.
Judy! Help!
Mama! Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
- I think I'm having a stroke. - Just try to stay calm, okay?
We'll be all right if we just stay calm. I'm too young to die!
Jenny. I've always loved you.
- Chowder! - Sorry.
Mama!
I can't look. Guys, come on.
Let's go. We're dead.
You've killed us and now we're dead.
I don't think the house knows that we're in here.
I bet it thinks we're still in the car.
Listen.
It sounds like it's sleeping.
The only way that we're gonna get out of here alive... ...is if we find the heart, we put out the fire.
Maybe we should examine our other options.
Sure. Other option:
We wait here and do nothing until it wakes up and eats us.
Find the heart, put out the fire. Got it.  Explosives.
That's so cool. - He was watching me.
- DJ. Did you ever see a wife?
People used to say he had one... ...but he fattened her up... ...and he ate her.
"Demolition squad."
Sorry.
Come on. Be quiet.
Don't worry, I have a very light step.
There.
Right there. Shoot it.  What?
I thought if I shot the heart, that...
- That's not the heart. - Then what is it?
Well, if those are the teeth and that's the tongue... ...then that must be the uvula.
So it's a girl house.
What? No.
It stimulates the gag reflex. Everyone has a uvula.
Not me. No.
Okay.
Let's move. We need to move quickly and quietly.
Don't touch anything.
And stay together...
- DJ! - Wait.  DJ.
I'll save you. Chowder, knock it off.
Sorry.
I thought you were... DJ!
- Chowder, it's a toy. - Oh, yeah.
Where's DJ?
- DJ. - Over here.  Look at all these toys.
This must be where Nebbercracker kept his stash.
"Stash."
I think you guys should have a look at this.
- The key.
- Come on, we don't have time for this.
Yeah, we've gotta find a way out of here. What are you doing?
We have a Ping-Pong table in our basement.
Constance.
Holy moly. He really did eat her.
Couldn't have.
Her whole body is buried in cement. Look at all this stuff.
Why would he build her a shrine if he murdered her?
Maybe he just felt guilty or something. DJ, can we please get out of here?
I always knew you were hiding something, Mr. Nebbercracker. DJ.
Way to go, big nose. - It's awake.
- Run! Hide.
Hey, I know that sound. My ball.
Where are you going? Come here.
- Chowder, come back. - You get back here.  Gotcha.
Killer Slinkys! - Chowder.
- Leave me alone! DJ!
Help! Oh, no.
Get off. Jenny.
Chowder. Come on, Chowder, grab on.
Gotcha. DJ, look out!
No!
The uvula. - DJ...
- Chowder.
Mommy! Gross.
Did we just get upchucked?
The uvula, nature's emergency exit. That's it.
Another great idea, DJ. Brilliant.
What do you want from me, Chowder?
I don't see you coming up with any big ideas.
Oh, yeah? Yeah?  Do you wanna hear my big idea?
I'm going home to make a pretzel sandwich. See you.
Chowder, the house is still alive and you're gonna wuss out?
I risked my life for you. I stole drugs for you... ...and I could've died in there.
- Yeah, me too.
You're the one that killed Nebbercracker in the first place.
- Getting your ball back. - You guys.
Stop fighting. You're acting like babies.
We are babies.
What were we thinking?
We tried to put a house to sleep with cold medicine.
- How lame can you get? - Where are you going?
I'm going home. I suck.  DJ.
At least it's an ambulance. DJ?
It's a ghost.
Begone. Fie.
Begone yourself. Get away.
He's not a ghost.
He's not dead. I'm not a murderer.
Of course I'm not dead. Who said I was dead?
You'll be dead if you don't scram.
- Come on, DJ. - Let's hurry.
Don't you know what day this is? I'm running out of time.
I'm running out of time.
Honey... ...I'm home.
Oh, look at you, dear.
Your shingles are all ruffled... ...and your windows are cracked.
Oh, but it's no problem, sweetheart. It's no problem at all.
It's her. The house is her.
- DJ, what are you doing? - Wait.  Come on.
- Come back. - Where you going?
Nothing paint and varnish can't handle.
Mr. Nebbercracker. I know about Constance.
You what?
What do you know? You don't know anything.  You were in my house?
You... You didn't kill her, did you?
I love her so much.
Hello? It's okay.
I can take you away from here.
Would you like that? Yes.
There we go.
Won't be long now. All right.
Okay, open your eyes.
- Now, it's not much, I know, but just... - Darling.  Get away from my house!
I'm gonna rip them to bits.
Help.
- Constance. - Help.  Help.
- What's wrong? Are you hurt?  - Hurt?
Yes, I'm hurt. Those criminals are attacking our house.
- Trick or treat.
- Now, now... ...they're just kids, dear.
- It's Halloween. - No, no, no.
It's my house, and they're hurting me.
Constance, look at me. Look at me.
As long as I'm here, I will never let anyone hurt you.
- Constance. - Sucker.
You vandals.
- Eat this. - You hooligans.
- I'll get you. - Constance, no!  So I finished the house.
She would've wanted that.
She died, but she didn't leave.
And that night... ...that one night of every year... ...I had to take precautions.
- Trick or treat. - I had to.
- Sucker. - I had to.  Hey!
Get a...
Stay away from my house!
She attacks anyone who comes near.
Go.
I'm coming, dear.
Go.
No, no, no, wait. I can't let you do this, Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know that you've been protecting us all these years.
But now it's our turn to protect you.
Let her go. But if I let her go... ...then I'll have no one.
That's not true. Constance, no!
Come on.
The house is alive! This way.
This way. Come on.
You guys, come on. - What are you doing?
- Trying to slow the house down.
Move it, pork chop. Come on, come on.  Come on, Mr. Nebbercracker.
Come on.
I can't. Mr. Nebbercracker.
Hurry.
Go on. I'll be all right.  Oh, man.
What are you waiting for? Come on.  You stay away from those children, Constance!
Constance.
Mr. Nebbercracker. Oh, now...
There, there, girl. My sweet.
You've been a bad girl, haven't you?
You've hurt people.
Oh, Constance.
Oh, we've always known this day would come. Haven't we?  I have to make things right.
I have to make things right. Constance.
I've always done what's best for you, haven't I? Haven't I, girl?
Come on, let's move.
Oh, Constance.
Let this be the right thing to do. Leave him alone!
Yeah, get your grubby branches off the old man! Take that!
And that!
Mr. Nebbercracker. Oh, kid, come here.
- Take this. - What?
You have to help me. Please.
I know you can do it. Go on.
Go. Hurry.
How do you know how to drive this thing?
I don't. The chimney.
The chimney leads to the heart. Jenny!
Jenny. Are you all right?
I'm not sure. DJ, get rid of that thing.
I'm working on it.
Chowder, I need you to get the house down under that crane.
Think you could do that?
Piece of cake.
Come on. You think you can just mess with my friends?
DJ, look. Mommy.
Chowder.
Come in, Chowder.
Chowder, buddy? Hey, guys.
Look who just won. It's me, the screw-up.
Way to go, Chowder, you did it! Look at me.  Look at Chowder.
- Sorry. - Guys, come on.  Yes.
Look at me. You can't do that.
That's not fair. No.
Get on the top. Help!  That's it, Chowder.
Keep her coming. You ain't nothing.
You're a shack. You're an outhouse.  No!
- I can't. - Yes, you can.  Go.
I kissed a girl.
I kissed a girl on the lips. Guys.
Any time now. Sorry.
DJ, hurry. I'm flying!
- On three, light the dynamite. - Okay, I got it.  - One.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Two. - Yes.  Thr...
DJ! Three!
Do you guys hear something? It's over there.
Come on.
Oh, my dear. Goodbye.
I'm sorry, Mr. Nebbercracker, about your house... ...and your wife.
Your house-wife. Forty-five years.
We have been trapped for 45 years.
And now... ...we're free.
We're free.
Thank you, friend.
Thank you all.
We're free. - Thank you.
- Thanks.
Happy Halloween. - Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.
Here you go.
- Thanks. - Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
Next. What happened to Nebbercracker's house?
It turned into a monster, so I blew it up.
Trick or treat.
We're gonna need a tricycle.
One tricycle, coming up.
Tricycle.
Tricycle.
- Tricycle. - Hello, tricycle.
I missed you so much.
- Thank you, mister. - Goodbye, now.
- Happy Halloween. - Come on.
- Mom. There's my mom.  - Jenny!
- One second. - Okay.
So...
We should hang out again.
Soon. - Yeah.
- Yeah.
See you. Good luck with the puberty.
She grabbed my butt.
That's nice, Chowder.
Hey, Mr. Nebbercracker. It's time to go.
Oh, you go on. I've got some work to do.
All right. Thanks.
- I'll see you around. - All right.  Bye.
Hey.
Stay off my lawn.
I'm just kidding.
- You think he'll be okay? - Yeah.  He'll be fine.
He'll go on vacation, get some color, maybe he'll meet someone new.
This time, maybe a nice beach house. Hey, DJ, look who's here.
- Yes, I can see that, thank you. - No biggie.
- Hey, boys. - Hey, Dad.  What the heck kind...?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.
It's... - Dirty pirates?
- That's it. Dirty pirates.  Fun, fun.
Oh, you look adorable.
Have fun tonight. You know, you were right.
We're definitely too old for trick-or-treating.
Oh, yeah. No question about it.
On the other hand... ...we've been working all night.
Candy time?
Candy time.
We're back. Yes.
Candy. - Did we just get...?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's Halloween, right?
What do you say you and I go out... ...and "inspect" some candy, huh?
We should go eat some candy too.
That's a good idea.
Okay. All right.  Let's go eat some candy.
Lots of yummy candy.
Like carrots.
All right, where's the car?
And that is how I slayed that mystical dragon.
Oh, yeah? That's great.
Come on, baby. We're out of here.
Not so fast, Bones.
Times have changed.
Skull's not like you.
He gives me the respect I deserve... ...and makes time for me.
Whatever. Bones!
Hello, fence. Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
-Lady Russell. -My dear Anne.
You look quite done for.
I came back as soon as I received your letter.
I had no idea the position was so ruinous.
Unfortunately, a person who's contracted debts must pay them.
-Even if he is a gentleman. -Was there no possibility of retrenchment?
Unfortunately, Father and Elizabeth could find no means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a manner simply not to be borne.
But I have, at last, persuaded Father to let out the house.
And if I can ensure that we live within our means somewhere less extravagant, then, in only a few years, we may be solvent again.
In a few years?
In any event, it is better than selling. At least one day I may hope to return.
And where are you to go in the meantime? Is it decided?
All my hopes were for a small house nearby, but Father and Elizabeth are settled upon Bath.
Lady Russell.
Dear neighbour, you've been in London, I hear.
Sir Walter. Elizabeth.
May I say how truly sorry I am that you must leave Kellynch.
We are blameless, Lady Russell, quite blameless.
Every sacrifice has been made, however painful.
We cut off all unnecessary charities at once, Lady Russell.
And even refrain from new furnishing the drawing room, which, as you know, Mama left the most frightful state.
And still it is a comfort to know we've done all we could.
Of course.
Ah, but here's Shepherd. He's promised us some news.
Is that his daughter with him?
Mrs Clay's husband passed away not long ago. She has returned to her father's house.
She's often with us, recently.
Lady Russell. Miss Anne.
Sir Walter, I have this very morning received an approach for the lease of Kellynch that I'm convinced must meet with your absolute approval.
An admiral, sir, recently retired and a native of this county desires to settle in this very part of the world.
-An admiral? -I should have much preferred a gentleman.
The navy has its uses, no doubt, but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it.
-Indeed, Sir Walter? -Yes.
It is, in two points, offensive to me.
The first is being the means of raising persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and second, you never see a naval man who is not most shockingly knocked about, exposed as they are to wind and weather till they're simply not fit to be seen.
Nevertheless, Sir Walter, the admiral has a very substantial fortune, and I have no doubt of him being a most responsible tenant.
And consider, Sir Walter, how he will look around and bless his good fortune to be in the home of a baronet of such a prominent and distinguished family.
Yes.
Then, with your permission, sir, I shall open negotiations with Admiral Croft.
-Croft? -Yes.
Are you acquainted with the gentleman, Miss Anne?
Yes. No, um...
That is to say, I'm familiar with his career.
I'm not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable by the tenant.
If you will excuse me, there's still much to do.
Good heavens, Anne.
-What is the matter with you? -Nothing. I assure you, I'm quite well.
Anne...
Who is Admiral Croft, and why did he cause you to be out of countenance so?
Anne!
Admiral Croft's wife is...
-Is... -Mrs Croft?
Indeed.
And Mrs Croft is the sister of Captain Frederick Wentworth.
Wentworth?
I see.
And to think that soon he may be walking through this house.
Anne, you know that your father thought it a most unsuitable match.
He would never have countenanced an alliance he deemed so degrading.
He was not alone, as I recall.
My dear...
To become engaged at 19, in the middle of a war, to a young naval officer who had no fortune and no expectations, you would, indeed, have been throwing yourself away.
And I should have been failing in my duty as your godmother if I did not counsel against it.
You were young, and it was entirely prudent to break off the understanding.
Prudent it may have been and yet,
Captain Wentworth has made his fortune in the war and is now extremely wealthy.
Has he written to you?
No, never a word.
I've only the newspapers for my authority.
Then...if his intentions towards you had been truly sincere, would he not have contacted you when his circumstances changed?
I do not blame you, nor myself for having been led by you.
But nevertheless,
I think very differently now from what I was persuaded to think eight years ago.
Oh, my dear Anne.
You are a good and beautiful young woman.
I promise you this, one day you will find someone to love you as you deserve.
I'm 27.
Before I forget, Shepherd, if you have no objection, I have a mind to engage your charming daughter as a companion to Elizabeth.
Oh, Sir Walter.
Well, I'm sure, sir, Penelope will be greatly honoured by such a distinction.
Then it is settled. She shall come with us to Bath tomorrow.
Is not Anne companion enough for Elizabeth?
Oh, but Anne is going to Uppercross.
I received a letter only this morning from sister Mary.
She is indisposed, again, and requires Anne to come and look after her.
And since nobody would want Anne in Bath,
I wrote back straightaway to say she should come as soon as she'd finished everything here.
Well...
All your hopes were for a small house nearby.
Do send our regards to the Musgroves.
Before you go, Anne, on no account must you forget to visit each house in the parish to take our leave.
Is he married?
I do not know that he is, and yet, so eligible a gentleman would surely by now have formed an attachment.
Will he bring his wife here?
And his children?
I only pray that I am spared any meeting.
I know my chance of happiness has passed forever, but to be reminded of it by his presence here would,
I'm certain, be more than my spirits could bear.
Who is that young lady, Mr Shepherd?
Oh, that is Miss Anne Elliot, Admiral, Sir Walter's middle daughter.
The only one with any sense.
A pity, then, that we did not make her acquaintance.
She is but half a mile away at Uppercross with her sister.
Oh, well then, we certainly shall make her acquaintance.
Is she married, Mr Shepherd?
Sadly no, ma'am. Nor, I think, at her age, is likely to be.
Well.
It is certainly roomier than a frigate.
Such a number of looking glasses. There's no getting away from oneself.
I think this room would do very well for Frederick.
Let us see if he comes.
Your brother seems dead set against the whole idea of Kellynch.
I fear Somerset has unpleasant memories for him.
There was once talk of an engagement to a girl in the county.
-There was? -Eight years ago or so.
We were in the East Indies at the time.
He's never spoken of it, but his heart was quite broken, I believe.
Well, well, well.
-Frederick engaged, who would have thought it? -Indeed.
-I sometimes wonder if he will ever settle down. -Hmm.
So, you are come, at last.
I'd begun to think I should never see you.
I am so ill
I can hardly speak.
In fact, I do not think I was ever so ill in my life as I have been all this morning.
I'm very unfit to be left alone, I'm sure.
Is Charles not here?
Charles would go out shooting, even though I told him I was ill.
And I have not seen a soul this whole, long morning.
Not one of the Musgroves has seen fit to come and see me even though Charles told them I was ill.
It did not suit, I suppose.
Oh, you will see them yet, I'm sure. It is still early.
Or, perhaps, if you feel well enough to attempt a short walk to the great house, we could call upon them.
We ought to wait till they call upon you.
They should know what is due to you as my sister.
I assure you I have not the smallest objection on that account.
Perhaps a little air would do me good.
But I really must eat something first, I'm quite starved.
Anne!
-Good heavens! How the girls are growing up. -Mmm-Hmm.
The Miss Musgroves have returned from their school in Exeter with all the usual accomplishments, and, of course, they now think of nothing but being fashionable and merry...
Dear Henrietta, Louisa!
Oh, Anne!
Here you are at last! Come, Mama cannot wait to see you.
And we have such exciting news.
Welcome to Uppercross, Miss Anne!
How pale and drawn you are.
We must fatten you up while you are here.
I myself have been very unwell.
And Sir Walter and Miss Elizabeth. Oh, how they shall miss you.
In any event, I'm very happy to be here and not in Bath.
Oh, Mama, I hope we shall be in Bath this winter.
But remember, if we do go, we must be in a good situation.
Oh, yes. None of your Queen's Squares for us.
-Anne, how are you? -Very well. Thank you, Charles.
-You're getting big. -I am glad to see you've recovered, my dear.
Did you ask your father? Did you, Charles?
Father has many other uses for his money and the right to spend it as he likes.
Charles, if it is left to you, we shall soon be destitute.
Admiral Croft and his wife are to take possession directly.
And I believe we have been very fortunate with our tenants.
Yet it must be very hard for you, my dear, to give up your home so.
Of course, when your poor dear Mama was alive, there was moderation and economy at Kellynch.
But there were never balls, and the Crofts are sure to have balls and invite the most eligible young naval officers.
Indeed, this is our exciting news, I quite forgot.
Mrs Croft, it appears, has a brother, Captain Wentworth, and he has just returned to England and is coming to stay with them at Kellynch.
It is true. The Pooles chanced to make their acquaintance in Taunton this week.
It is said Captain Wentworth is the most handsomest man in the navy and quite unattached.
-And has such a wealth of Spanish gold. -Indeed.
Well, we shall all see for ourselves when he comes to dine tomorrow night.
Oh, Papa!
I have just now received this note from Admiral Croft accepting my invitation.
Anne! Are you ready?
We must not keep the Crofts and Captain Wentworth waiting.
Charles! Charles!
Charles! Come directly. Charles!
He fell from a tree in the garden.
I've sent for the apothecary. He will be here directly.
His collarbone is dislocated.
Charles, look after Mary. We shall be all right.
Ready?
All done. With a little rest, he'll be right as rain in no time.
Oh, thank God.
And never fear, Charles, I shall give your excuses to the Crofts.
Excuses?
Indeed, with the child going on so well now, it would be a shame to spoil the dinner.
I am really most anxious to meet our new neighbours.
Indeed, it's more a duty than anything else.
If Anne will stay with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.
Of course.
And so we are to be left to shift for ourselves with a sick child, while you go to dinner with the Crofts.
Well, I need not stay too late, dearest.
Just because I'm the poor mother who is not allowed to stir, because he is going on so well.
He says... How does he know he is going on so well...
Please.
You may all leave little Charles to my care.
Well, this is very kind of you, Anne. Are you sure?
In any case, I've no appetite.
Well then, it is settled.
Oh, Anne, you missed the most delightful party last night.
I cannot tell you how handsome is Captain Wentworth.
He is so much more handsome and agreeable than anyone I have ever met before.
-Such manners, such conversation. -Such capital.
Oh, and we have all been invited to Kellynch tomorrow night for dinner.
Even you, Anne.
- Damn it, Mary, I'm late. Is he here? - Who?
Oh, Captain Wentworth, do...do come in.
Forgive me, I... The door was open.
I trust the boy does well?
-Oh, yes. -Much better, thank you, Wentworth.
Oh, Captain Wentworth, this is my elder sister Anne.
-We are acquainted. -Really? But Anne has never said a word about it.
It was a long time ago, you were away at school.
Come, Wentworth, or the birds will all have gone south for the winter.
Of course. Ladies.
Oh, come, Henrietta, let us go with them.
Wait, wait, wait for me.
The worst is over. I have seen him.
We have been once more in the same room.
A bow, a curtsy,
I heard his voice and then, he was gone.
He has not forgiven me.
I have used him ill, deserted and disappointed him.
And worse, I've shown a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident temper could not endure.
Once there were no two hearts so open, no feelings so in harmony, but now we are strangers.
Worse than strangers for we may never become acquainted.
It is perpetual estrangement.
And tonight, I'm to be tested once more.
Frederick! There you are. Let me introduce you to Miss Anne Elliot.
Miss Elliot, my brother, Captain Frederick Wentworth.
Captain Wentworth and I met briefly yesterday.
Oh, Frederick, you might have told me.
This must be very bad for you, Miss Elliot, to come to your home and find us here.
No, not at all, Admiral. I'm happy to know that the house is in such worthy and careful hands.
And what news, Frederick, of dear Captain Harville?
He's settled for now at LYme with our good friend James Benwick
-who's awaiting a new command. -How exciting.
Of course. I remember Captain Benwick. He's engaged to Harville's sister.
I'm sorry to have to tell you that she died last summer while Benwick was out at the Cape.
-Oh, no. How dreadful. -Yes.
Five years they waited for a fortune to satisfy her family.
Now he has it, of course, but too late. Much too late.
But then I've never thought that a man on active service
-should even contemplate marriage. -Have you indeed?
A frigate at wartime is no place for a woman and the long separations are a sore trial to both parties.
Oh, how true. There is nothing so bad as a separation.
As I know to my cost, for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes and I'm so glad when he's safe home again.
But now I'm paid off and ashore, Sophy, you'll be delighted to hear that I'm, at last, resolved to settle down.
Indeed, Frederick, I'm delighted to hear it. Pray, do you have anyone in mind?
No, no, I'm quite ready to make a foolish match with any woman between 15 and 30.
A little beauty, a few smiles, and a compliment to the navy and I shall be lost.
Oh, come, Frederick.
After all, what right has a humble sailor to expect any better?
But if I am to speak in earnest, what I desire above all in a wife is firmness of character.
A woman who knows her own mind.
I cannot abide timidity or feebleness of purpose.
A weak spirit which is always open to persuasion, first one way and then the other, can never be relied upon.
Well, we must see what we can do.
Oh, Anne, play us something to dance to.
-Yes, Anne, will you? Something jolly. -Oh, yes.
Do you know, I believe that I've never seen a pleasanter man in all my life than Captain Wentworth.
Hmm.
He was not very gallant by Anne, though, was he?
When Louisa asked him what he thought of you the other night he said you were so altered, he should not have known you again.
-I would not swear he used exactly those words. -Although he was most attentive to me.
It must be said he would make a capital match for Louisa.
Louisa! Stuff and nonsense, Charles. It is clear he is all for Henrietta.
But, my love, surely you cannot have forgotten that Henrietta has an understanding
-with my cousin, Charles Hayter. -Indeed, I have not.
But I cannot say the same of Henrietta.
And quite right, too.
For who, pray, is Charles Hayter? Nothing but a country curate.
What a degrading alliance for a connection of the Elliots.
Now, there you talk nonsense, my dear.
He will inherit the estate at Winthrop, and the farm near Taunton, and he is a very amiable young man.
Well, I do not think a young woman has the right to marry anyone, however amiable if he is disagreeable or inconvenient to her family.
No, no, what stuff.
If Henrietta has Charles Hayter and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth,
I shall be very well satisfied.
Well, what do you say, Anne? Does the Captain prefer Louisa or Henrietta?
Wentworth!
We're just going over to Winthrop to visit Cousin Charles, Henrietta's intended.
Why don't you come with us, Anne. I'm sure the Hayters would love to see you again.
Capital idea, Louisa, we shall all go.
I know Mary's in a fine sweat to see Cousin Charles again.
Catch me.
Anne!
It is nothing.
Thank you. I'm well.
It is really nothing.
But I think, perhaps, I'd better stay here and rest a little while.
-Then I shall remain with you. -No, please, I...
I would hate to inconvenience you and I... I know my way to Winthrop perfectly well.
I shall catch up with you directly.
Please, Charles.
Very well. If you insist.
Ah, see? There is Winthrop.
You had all better go on without me. I am really excessively tired.
It would be very rude of us to come all this way and not call on our cousins.
I will stay with Mary, Charles.
If you and Henrietta want to go on and pay our respects to the Hayters.
And I am sure Captain Wentworth will offer us his protection.
Very well.
Henrietta.
It is most unpleasant, having such connections, Captain Wentworth.
But I assure you, I have never been in that house above twice.
In my life.
I wonder where Anne has got to.
Mary is good-natured enough in many respects.
But she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense.
She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.
You know, we all wish Charles had married Anne instead.
-Anne? -Oh, yes.
-Did you not know he wanted to marry Anne? -No. I did not.
-Do you mean to say she refused him? -Oh, yes, certainly.
When did this happen?
I do not exactly know, but before he married Mary.
Did she say why she would not marry?
Well...
Papa always said it was her great friend Lady Russell's doing.
He thought Charles might not be bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and so she persuaded Anne to refuse him.
I myself would have no idea of being so easily persuaded.
When I have made up my mind, I have made it.
And I'm quite determined.
Yours is a character, I see, of decision and firmness.
And I honour it.
Oh, look. They have brought Charles Hayter with them. Come.
Ah! There you are.
We thought we might cross your wake if we drove out this way.
Admiral Croft, Mrs Croft.
We've just paid a visit to my cousin, Charles Hayter.
Oh.
Miss Elliot, you must be tired. Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home to Uppercross.
Oh, no, thank you, no. It is too much trouble.
Oh, no, we are returning in any case by that road and there's plenty of room.
- Really, you're too kind. - Stuff, Miss Elliot.
-You must come with us, indeed you must. -Oh.
- Walk on. -Thank you, Captain.
I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvas and bring home one of those two young ladies to Kellynch.
He means to have one of them. There's just no saying which one.
They're both very good-natured, unaffected girls, indeed.
They're a very respectable family. What do you think, Miss Elliot?
It won't be long, if I'm any judge.
Now I understand him.
He can never forgive me.
He condemns me still for the past and is becoming now quite attached to another.
And yet...
Anne! We are to go to LYme tomorrow morning.
Captain Wentworth must visit his best friend,
Captain... Something or other.
And has invited us all to make the trip with him. Ain't it prime?
No, indeed, I'm sure I'd better stay here with the children.
Am I to go without you?
In my delicate state of recovery?
Suppose I were to be seized rather suddenly in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell for servants?
Quite attached to another.
And yet...
Still he cannot be unfeeling.
He cannot see me suffer without wishing to give relief, to spare the proof of his own good, warm and amiable heart, which I cannot contemplate without infinite pain and regret.
The sea!
-I love the sea! -I'm sure I love it more than you do.
Frederick!
Come on!
Captain Harry Harville, Captain James Benwick, Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove.
Miss Henrietta Musgrove, Miss Louisa Musgrove, Miss Elliot.
Miss Anne Elliot?
Yes.
Capital.
Oh, my God, the air!
Of course, the admiralty amuse themselves every now and then by sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed.
-It's true. -But they do have a great many...
Captain Benwick, may I say how sorry I was to hear of your terrible loss.
Thank you.
There never was a love like ours.
And never will be again.
There were a great many to provide for and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to distinguish which may be least missed.
And yet, Captain, you are still young, and I pray you may one day rally and be happy with another.
A man does not forget a woman as readily as you forget us.
I will not allow a woman's nature to be more unconstant than a man's.
And yet, you will allow that poetry and novels are against you.
They tell us endlessly of the fickleness of women.
And are they not all written by men?
Yes, Miss Elliot. Perhaps they are.
I see we shall not readily agree on this.
I would never suppose that true constancy is known only by women, but the one claim I shall make for my own sex is that we love longest when all hope is gone.
A toast. The navy.
The navy. The navy.
You did a good deed. Cheering up so with poor Benwick last night.
I've not known him talk so much.
Not in a long time.
In time, we found a common interest in poetry.
He reads nothing else. Day in, day out.
Never happier he is than when reading impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony or sundered hearts destroyed by wretchedness.
Yes.
I did venture to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study.
It's bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is.
But what can we do?
Well, he's young.
And time is a great healer.
Or so, at least, I'm told.
Oh.
-Forgive me. -Not at all.
Who is that gentleman?
Mr William Elliot, sir. Came in last night on his way to Bath for the winter.
William Elliot? Bless me, Anne, it must be our cousin William. It must, indeed!
- He is handsome! -He is not!
Did he mention a connection to the Elliots of Kellynch at all?
He certainly said he would one day be a baronet.
There. It is him, it is.
He seems of particular interest, this cousin?
Sir Walter has no sons, so his title and the estate of Kellynch will pass to the cousin.
What a pity we should not have been introduced to each other.
His father and Mr Elliot have not been on speaking terms since his unfortunate marriage.
An introduction would have hardly been welcome.
You'll hardly be able to avoid seeing each other in Bath.
You'll be sure to mention our seeing him next time you write to Father.
On the contrary.
Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?
-Captain Wentworth, catch me. -Louisa.
-Louisa. Louisa, no! Louisa, no!
Louisa!
A surgeon. A surgeon, quickly.
-Of course. -Captain Benwick.
Captain Benwick knows where one can be found.
Send him to the inn.
Keep this pressed firmly against the wound.
Charles, it appears she'll be here some time. Her parents should be told.
But I would rather not leave her. Not tonight.
Let me go. And if you wish, I'll take Henrietta and Mary with me.
And not Anne?
If Anne will stay, there is no one so proper, so capable.
Louisa needs no other.
But Anne...
Anne is to stay, who is nothing to Louisa, while I am sent packing?
Now, my dear, I'm sure the captain...
-Am I not as capable as Anne? -Of course you are.
Am I not as proper?
And to be sent home without Charles, too, without my husband, in my condition, no.
No, it is too unkind.
I will go with Henrietta.
Go on.
Miss Elliot,
I've been thinking whether you had not better remain with Henrietta while I go in and break it to the Musgrove's alone.
Do you think this is a good plan?
I do.
I must see Mr Musgrove without delay.
Tell him Captain Frederick Wentworth is here. I must speak with him directly.
It is done.
I shall return now to LYme and see if I can be of any... any assistance.
I believe the Musgroves will soon follow.
Thank you.
Captain,
I'm most anxious.
If you would have...
If you'd be so kind as to have word sent to me in Bath as to how Louisa does.
In Bath?
I'm not needed in LYme or any longer at Uppercross.
I must rejoin my father.
Our house is in Camden Place.
-You dislike Bath most heartily, as I recall. -I do.
But I have an old school friend who lives there and...
I have the consolation also of Lady Russell's company.
Very well, then.
Goodbye, Miss Elliot.
Goodbye, Captain Wentworth.
Certainly now, with Anne here,
I'll not suppose myself at all wanted.
Nonsense, Penelope, she is nothing to me, indeed, compared to you.
My dear madam, you must not run away from us now. It must not be.
Please, Penelope.
Ah, Anne, there you are.
How are you, Anne?
Are we greatly missed at Kellynch?
But let me assure you, Bath has more than answered our expectations in every respect.
Indeed, our house is undoubtedly the finest in Camden Place.
You can be sure that the acquaintance of the Elliots is most exceedingly sought after.
And best of all, Miss Anne, your cousin Mr Elliot is here in Bath and is quite reconciled with Sir Walter.
-Mr Elliot?
-Indeed, he has called repeatedly, has dined with us once.
Evidently delighted at the distinction of being asked.
And clearly places his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.
He has offered his most handsome apologies for any former appearance of neglect in his duties towards us.
And Mrs Elliot?
Dead. Quite dead.
Certainly his wife was a nobody, while a beauty and rich, but we must make allowances, he was young and foolish.
Not any more. Such elegant manners.
So gentlemanly and fashionable.
Indeed, I have no objection to being seen with him anywhere.
-Ah, that will be Lady Russell, no doubt. -No.
That is Mr Elliot's knock. I am sure of it.
I believe you are right.
The poor man simply cannot keep away from you, Miss Elliot.
Upon my word, Penelope.
I am scarcely aware of his intentions being beyond those of other men.
How is Mary looking?
Last time I saw her she was... Well, she had a red nose.
-Oh, she is quite well, thank you, Father. -Good.
My apologies for calling so unexpectedly but I could not rest without knowing that Miss Elliot had not taken cold yesterday.
Oh, how exceedingly kind of you, Mr Elliot.
Ah, my dear sir, give me leave to present my daughter Anne.
But this is extraordinary.
Our paths have crossed before, Sir Walter, at LYme not a week past.
-Not that I could expect Miss Elliot to remember. -Indeed I do remember, Mr Elliot, very clearly.
How extraordinary that we should be guests at the same inn at the same time.
Yes, it is.
One might almost say...providential.
I cannot tell you how relieved I am to see her recovering so.
Yes and she will make an excellent wife, Frederick. I congratulate you.
I beg your pardon?
Come, sir, you're mistaken if you think you've kept your intentions towards Louisa Musgrove a secret.
You mean to say you consider an understanding exists between myself and Miss Musgrove?
-Of course. Do you deny it? -I do.
Do you mean to tell me you don't care for her at all?
No, not in that way, no. Rest assured.
Well, then I fear you'll gravely disappoint both her and her family.
They talk of little else.
Dear God, Harry, have I been so unguarded, so thoughtless?
It would appear that you have.
Well, if what you say is true then I must, in all honour, regard myself as bound to her.
Indeed, Frederick. I am afraid you seem to have entangled yourself.
This is dreadful. What can I do?
Perhaps you might take your leave of LYme on some pretext, and await Louisa's recovery elsewhere.
It is perhaps possible a prolonged absence may weaken the bonds between you.
I have been meaning to visit my brother in Shropshire.
Capital.
-Captain Wentworth and Louisa Musgrove? -It's quite true. I assure you.
Any day now I expect to hear news of the engagement.
And you, child, are you reconciled to it?
Oh, yes, indeed.
-I wish them every happiness. -Mmm. Of course.
Oh, look, there's our Mr Elliot with the Wallaces.
I must admit he does have a very pleasant manner.
Indeed he does. And yet...
And yet?
I cannot help feeling that there must be something more than immediately appears in this sudden interest in our family, after so many years.
You refer to Elizabeth, I take it.
She is very handsome.
Well, he has nothing to gain from a reconciliation.
His late wife, however unsuitable a match, was exceedingly wealthy, and in any case nothing can prevent him from inheriting Kellynch and the baronetcy along with it.
Nothing except my father marrying again and providing himself at last with a male heir.
Ah. No, indeed.
And Mrs Clay is young and altogether well-looking.
I wonder at Elizabeth, to place such a woman under your father's nose so.
We must be vigilant.
-Ah, Lady Russell. -Ah, Lady Cavendish.
My dearest cousin, once again providence seems eager to throw us together.
Good morning, Mr Elliot.
I confess, I called nearly an hour ago at Camden Place and was most distressed to find you absent.
My father was quite taken up with some sensational news in this morning's paper.
You refer, of course, to your cousins, the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and her daughter the Honourable Miss Carteret, who arrive in Bath today.
You are very well informed, Mr Elliot.
Your father may have mentioned something on the subject.
I do not doubt that he did.
You do not seem anxious to make their acquaintance again.
I agree.
The Dalrymples are nothing in themselves, but family connections are always worth preserving.
And they are regarded everywhere as good company.
My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people who have a great deal of conversation.
You are mistaken. That is not good company.
That is the best.
No, good company requires only birth, manners and education and, with regard to education, I'm afraid it is not very particular.
Oh, my cousin Anne shakes her head. She is not satisfied.
In one point, however, I'm sure we must feel alike.
We welcome any addition to your father's society which diverts his thoughts from those who, well, are beneath him.
You refer to Mrs Clay?
It is possible that I do.
My concern is that my father may be rendered unhappy by the connection.
But perhaps I'm too fastidious.
My dear Anne, you have a better right to be fastidious than any woman I've ever met.
Oh, good heavens.
Mr Elliot not with you?
There is a letter come for you from Uppercross.
If you are quick you may just have time to read it before he calls again!
My dear Anne, I rejoice to tell you that Louisa improves daily and will soon be quite her old self.
I am also told we shall soon hear wedding bells at Uppercross, although I'm sworn to secrecy on the subject and may say no more.
But Mama says the local dressmakers will not answer for such an occasion.
So, expect to see us at Bath next week for a fitting.
Until then, I remain your affectionate brother-in-law, Charles Musgrove.
Anne.
Anne! Anne!
Come, come, Anne, we must not be late.
You cannot have forgotten we have an invitation from Lady Dalrymple.
I regret I am already engaged to spend the evening with an old school friend.
Not that sickly old widow in Westgate Buildings?
-Mrs Smith, yes. -Smith?
-Westgate Buildings? -Excuse me.
And who, pray, is Mrs Smith?
One of the 5,000 Smiths that are everywhere to be met with?
Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most extraordinary taste.
To place such a person ahead of your own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland.
Mrs Smith.
Perhaps she's not the only poor widow in Bath with little to live on and no surname of dignity.
Good evening.
-Anne. -Harriet.
-How are you? -I'm well, thank you. Much better.
This is my nurse Mrs Rooke.
-How do you do, Miss Elliot? -Mrs Rooke.
I am truly sorry I've been unable to visit before this.
My time has not been my own.
Oh, but we are deeply honoured to have a cousin of Lady Dalrymple pay us a visit here this evening instead of calling upon her relations with the rest of her family.
You will soon learn that absolutely nothing happens in Bath without Nurse Rooke hearing of it.
Come, dearest Anne, tell me everything that has happened to you in the past 12 years.
Harry!
Harry! Harry!
Frederick.
I called at the inn but Louisa's gone back home to Uppercross, I find.
A week ago, at least. Benwick took her. She's quite recovered.
How is your brother?
He thinks I'm as big a fool as I do.
You have no idea, Harry, how I... how I curse the folly of my own pride.
Had I only the good sense to seize my happiness when I had the chance again and none of this would have happened.
I'm not sure I follow.
I imagine myself indifferent to her but I was only angry and resentful.
Too late.
Too late I began to understand myself and her.
Never, never have I met her equal in good sense or sweetness of character.
She's perfection itself.
I've never loved any but her.
-We are talking now of Anne Elliot? -Of course, who else?
Then I take it you have not received Benwick's letter.
I shall have to go to Uppercross now. It cannot, in all decency, be avoided.
I mention this letter only because it contains the news that he has proposed to Louisa Musgrove.
She has accepted him. They are to be married directly.
Married?
-Louisa and Benwick? -Directly.
Then... Then I'm free.
As it happens, I'm going to Bath tomorrow.
Perhaps now you'd care to join me.
And whom should I chance to meet at the Pump Rooms again yesterday but Mr Elliot.
Without being indiscreet,
I can reveal that you were very much talked of.
He thinks you a most extraordinary young woman.
In your temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.
Now, I am no matchmaker, as you well know, but a most suitable connection.
And I do think there would be every possibility of your and Mr Elliot being very happy together.
And, I must confess, to look forward and think of you occupying your dear mother's place as the future mistress of Kellynch.
The future Lady Elliot.
Oh, my dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life.
Lady Russell.
Will you join us?
I cannot deny the idea of being restored to Kellynch, of calling it home again, my home forever, has a charm I cannot immediately resist.
And Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and, in many respects, I think very highly of him.
Admiral and Mrs Croft come to call on Miss Anne Elliot.
Admiral, Mrs Croft, I'm delighted to see you.
What brings you here to Bath?
I'm afraid, Miss Elliot, it is my digestion.
And when your sister Mary learned we were to come to Bath, she charged us with this letter for you.
Thank you. You must stay for tea.
And tell me the news from Kellynch.
Well, all the talk, of course, has been of the marriage.
-The marriage? -Why, your cousin of course.
Miss Louisa Musgrove.
Do you mean to tell me you did not know?
No, indeed.
I only had a note from Charles that we were to soon expect a wedding.
Oh, well, then I'm sure the letter we have brought from your sister will contain a full account.
I'm very happy for Louisa.
- I am certain she has chosen wisely. - Indeed, indeed.
Oh, he's a fine fellow, right enough.
And whatever Frederick may say, she has no fears of being a naval captain's wife.
No, indeed.
I must confess the news did come as something of a surprise to us.
Even Sophy was taken aback.
Really? Did he give you no indication of his intentions?
No. No, never a word on the subject.
But Frederick is not a man to pine or complain.
No, he very honourably hoped she will be very happy with Benwick and there's an end to it.
In fact, from his manner of speaking on the subject, one would never guess Frederick could have ever thought of Louisa Musgrove for himself.
Benwick?
I beg your pardon?
Am I, then, to understand that Louisa is to marry Captain Benwick and not Captain Wentworth?
Yes. Yes, that's it exactly.
Poor Frederick. Now he will have to begin all over with somebody else.
Miss Anne, is something wrong?
No. No, you astonished me indeed.
You mean, you did not know?
The thing is certainly true. We have it from Frederick himself.
-Captain Wentworth is in Bath? -He arrived last night.
Oh.
Captain Wentworth.
Miss Elliot.
Your sister mentioned your being in Bath.
Yes, I'm lodging with the Admiral in Queen's Square.
You've perhaps also heard that Louisa Musgrove is to marryJames Benwick.
-I have. I was most astonished. -As was I.
And yet, I'm sure in time they will grow more alike.
Captain Benwick will gain high spirits and cheerfulness and she will...
Relish for morbid poetry.
Just so.
With all my soul, I wish them happy, and yet...
Miss Louisa is a very good, amiable, sweet-tempered girl.
Harville's sister was a very superior woman, and Benwick's attachment to her was, indeed, profound.
A man cannot recover from such a passion with such a woman.
He ought not.
He does not.
My dear Anne, I cannot say how grieved I am to have kept you waiting, but the carriage is outside.
Mr Elliot, permit me to name Captain Wentworth.
My cousin Mr Elliot.
May I?
Captain, there is a concert at the Pump Rooms tonight.
I remember how fond you are of music.
I must say, though, the worst of Bath is the number of plain women.
I frequently observe that one pretty face would be followed by five and thirty frights.
And as for the men...
Oh!
Ah, Lady Russell.
We are at home tomorrow night to a somewhat select gathering...
-We do so hope you are at liberty. -Of course, Sir Walter, with pleasure.
But where is Lady Dalrymple?
Good heavens, is that Frederick Wentworth?
Isn't he the nobody?
What on earth is he doing in Bath?
Captain Wentworth, is the programme to your liking?
I found myself at liberty this evening.
Bath has much to offer those who are interested in music.
So I'm led to believe.
And shall you be staying long in Bath?
I don't know.
That is to say, I am not certain.
It all depends.
I see.
-Miss Elliot... -Captain.
Lady Dalrymple.
Anne, Anne, Lady Dalrymple is here.
There'll soon be another marriage in that family, if I'm any judge.
Certainly, if the rumours are to be believed.
Captain.
-Are you going? -Yes.
Is the first half, at least, not worth staying for?
No.
There's nothing here worth me staying for. Good night.
My dear Anne, is all well?
We are all so dreadfully concerned.
Yes.
I felt suddenly a little faint.
But I'm quite recovered.
Should we not return to the concert?
Dearest Anne,
I have been awaiting an opportunity to speak to you privately and now it seems to have come.
-I'm sorry, sir, I'm not very good company.
-My dear cousin, you are far too modest for the world in general to be aware
-of even half your accomplishments. -Really, sir,
-I do not think you know me that well. -On the contrary.
The name of Anne Elliot has long had a beguiling charm for me.
If I dared, I would now breathe my sincerest wish that name might never change.
-Sir...
-I do not venture to expect an immediate answer to my proposal.
But I cannot, in honour, further conceal my intentions and perhaps tomorrow night at Camden Place you will feel able to make me the happiest and most fortunate of men.
Miss Elliot, I am charged with an urgent commission from the Admiral in regard to your family.
And since I am to leave Bath today without delay,
I should be obliged if I could wait upon you at 11:00 this morning.
Hello, Anne, how are you?
Charles, Mary.
I am here to take the waters.
I have been most dreadfully unwell, it is my last hope.
Father, Elizabeth.
Good heavens, it's Mary.
Sir Walter, Elizabeth, we have come to choose a wedding dress with mother and Henrietta.
-Who? -A mere country curate.
-Father, pray, do not trouble yourself. -And dear Louisa, is she not with you?
She stayed at Uppercross with Captain Benwick.
-Who? -The naval captain, Father.
Pray, do not trouble yourself.
I suppose we shall have to invite the Musgroves tonight as well.
A party?
I shall be loathe to introduce them to Lady Dalrymple.
Will Mr Elliot be there? I must at all costs be introduced to Mr Elliot.
Well, I have not the smallest intention of inviting him, but...
Wentworth.
-Charles. -Hello, old fellow, how are you?
I didn't expect to see you here.
Where are you staying? We must go shooting one day, if you have time.
-Mrs Musgrove. -Captain.
Father, this is Captain Wentworth.
He is related to our tenants, the Crofts.
Captain, this is my father, Sir Walter Elliot, baronet.
Yes and my eldest sister Elizabeth.
-Thank you, we are acquainted. -Captain, please.
I am charged.
That is to say the Admiral, Admiral Croft, has been confidently informed... that Mr Elliot...
That everything is settled now in your family for a union between yourself and Mr Elliot.
It was added that you were to live at Kellynch, and my commission from the Admiral is to say that, if the family's wish is such, his lease at Kellynch shall be cancelled and he and my sister will provide themselves with another home.
That is all.
What answer shall I give?
Sir...
You will please thank the Admiral on my behalf, but I must tell you that he is utterly misinformed.
Misinformed?
-Utterly? -Yes, Captain.
Quite mistaken.
-No truth in any part of it? -None.
And I should be grateful to know the source of such fanciful rumours.
As to that...
Lady Russell is here.
Do you remember Lady Russell, Captain?
How could I forget?
Anne, I received your note.
Miss Elliot, if you'll excuse me I shall convey your news to the Admiral.
-Good day. -Captain.
Is it true? Mr Elliot has proposed?
If you'll excuse me, Lady Russell, I must speak with Captain Wentworth.
Captain Wentworth.
Mrs Musgrove.
Anne.
What a delight.
Excuse me.
Anne, I must speak with you.
Must it be now?
Anne, I must ask. Is it true Mr Elliot has asked you to marry him?
-Yes, but...
-Anne, I hope I give no offence, but I can never forgive myself if I did not acquaint you with Mr Elliot's real character.
-I only hope I'm not too late. -Good heavens, Harriet, what is it?
Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience.
A designing, cold-blooded being who thinks only of itself.
His recent reconciliation with your father was no accident.
He had heard a rumour in London that Sir Walter Elliot might be led to marry his daughter's companion.
-Mrs Clay? -The very same.
And should she provide him with an heir, of course, the child would inherit everything, instead of Mr Elliot.
-But he is already rich. -Of course.
He married his poor wife for money and nothing else.
But what he now desires above all is to be a baronet.
He cannot bear the thought of not being Sir William.
Well, why, then, would he wish to marry me?
Oh, his admiration for you is sincere, as far as it goes.
Although it has not prevented him from courting Mrs Clay at the same time.
-No. -Indeed.
He has promised to establish her as his mistress in London, as soon as he is married to you.
There is nothing he would not do to prevent your father marrying again.
I am profoundly grateful to you, Harriet.
But now if you'll forgive me, I must go.
-Captain Harville. -Miss Elliot.
If you have come to call upon the Admiral and Mrs Croft, I must disappoint you.
They went to take the waters with Captain Wentworth.
But since you are here, you may save me some time.
Captain Wentworth bade me bring this note to you in Camden Place.
Perhaps you would take it now.
-Thank you. -Are you quite well, Miss Elliot?
Thank you.
Then if you'll excuse me, I'm already late for an appointment.
Miss Elliot, I can bear this no longer.
You pierced my soul. I'm half agony, half hope.
Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant.
I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years ago.
I have loved none but you.
You alone, who brought me to Bath, for you alone, I think and plan.
Have you not seen this?
I can hardly write.
I must go, uncertain of my fate.
A word, a look, would be enough.
Only tell me that I am...
Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone forever.
Why, Miss Elliot, you just missed Frederick.
He has just gone to call upon you at Camden Place.
Anne!
-Charles! -Anne, good heavens, is anything the matter?
Anne.
Thank you, Charles, I'm quite...quite well.
You look quite done for. We shall have to get you home directly.
The thing of it is, I ought to be in the marketplace now.
A fellow there promised me the sight of a capital gun he's just sending off.
Said he'd keep it unpacked till the last possible minute.
If I do not cut along now I shall miss out.
You know from his description, Wentworth, it sounds a good deal like that 16-bore Mortimer of mine you shot with that day round Winthrop.
Do you remember?
Captain...
Captain,
I am...I am in receipt of your proposal and am minded to accept it.
Thank you.
Are you quite certain?
I am.
I am determined.
I will.
And nothing, you may be sure, will ever persuade me otherwise.
Why have we stopped?
You can't see?
Give me your hand.
I thought you might like to see your wedding present.

Serena Van Der Woodsen.
(Camera shutter clicks) I was coming off the end of "the O.C."
And had very little interest in doing another teen drama.
And then I got sent the first book in the "Gossip Girl" book series, and I was like, "I may be ready to leave high school after all".
Don't ever go to high school, Dorota.
The girls are spoiled, stupid, and ungrateful!
Stephanie savage is one of the smartest, most talented people I've ever met, and she got really excited about it as well, and we were off to the races.
The setting in New York City and this elite Upper East Side society... that's, for sure, a world that is really alluring.
Are you following us or something?
No. I... I...
I go to your school. The books really laid it out very well.
They're juicy and salacious and fun and everything is said with a bit of a wink.
What's that, your stripper money?
"Sex and the City" had gone off the air.
There was really nothing on TV that had that romantic version of New York, and I really missed that just as a fan.
And then, of course, the anonymous online blogger who was watching everybody's moves and reporting it.
Is that true? What? You were in jail?
(Stephanie) That was something that felt like it was a real hook to the show.
And who am I?
That's one secret I'll never tell.
When Cecily wrote the book in 2002, uh, Perez Hilton and TMZ didn't even exist, so she had really kind of imagined something that ultimately came to pass.
Oh, my God. You'll never believe what's on "Gossip Girl."
Someone saw Serena getting off a train at grand central.
The tag line for the first season was, "you're nobody until you're talked about."
It definitely was ahead of the trend.
The lives that these kids were living was so fascinating that there was a web site devoted to them that they had to read endlessly, and I think it just really captured the moment of the world we were in. ♪
It was really important to us that we actually shoot the show in New York.
That's the thing they say about New York, is you point the camera in any direction and it looks good, not to mention this... the authenticity.
(Girl) Hey, Serena. Why don't you get a room?
Oh, that's the plight of the Manhattan teenager. No cars.
(Chuckles) (Camera shutters click)
A lot of shows are "based in New York" but film in L.A.
And so you don't get the magic of walking down, you know, a street in Soho and seeing all the things happening and all the cabs going around in the background.
It's very much one of the most important elements of the show.
Dan! Oh, my God!
This is what I love about this city. You're always bumping into people.
Stephanie went and kind of immersed herself in the, uh, in the girls prep school world.
I stayed at the Carlyle Hotel and I did research, talking to about a dozen girls, asking them questions about their lives.
I reviewed your record.
If Constance has a shining star, it's Blair Waldorf.
I know.
I'm the perfect one.
Stephanie is so involved in every single detail.
She typed out her own little essays of girls who lived on the Upper East Side, and they were even more wild than the books.
I've been drinking on an empty stomach. I heard you didn't do that anymore.

Oh.
I don't know exactly how I tune in to that kind of upbringing or lifestyle, because that's not how I was raised at all.

Serena, as happy as I am to have you home, you have no idea what it's been like.
We really wanted this idea of, like, family and relationships, all these things that are so universal to, uh, any coming-of-age story, to be true here.
We deal with the same things, at the end of the day. ♪
At first, we didn't have a lot of access in New York City.
It was like, "well, what is this show? I don't know."
But very, very quickly, I think people recognized that if you were on the show, it was a good thing.
(Amplified voice) Welcome, all, to the McKittrick Hotel.
At the beginning, that was great because every... every new location was somewhere, you know, we hadn't maybe seen before... the backroom of some cool bar, you know, and "oh, I wanna come back here."
We always saw the show as a real love letter to New York City.
Now there are "Gossip Girl" tours of New York City where you go by the locations that the characters visited.
When Mayor Bloomberg was here, and it's like, "oh, my God. That's amazing."
Therefore, I, Michael R. Bloomberg, mayor of the city of New York, do hereby proclaim

Congratulations.

It's been everything we hoped it would be.

You're kinda not invited. ♪
Josh and I are psychos about casting, and we really did feel, with "Gossip Girl," that we had something special.
At the time, I was living in L.A.
And I was auditioning every single day for pilots.
And automatically, I was like, "I love Blair.
I wanna play that character."
So I auditioned for it probably, like, 20 times.
(Chace) It was, like, probably my number four read.
Wow.
I kinda sit in this little swivel chair, and... (Chuckles) this girl just kind of swivels around and, like, cute as a button, and it was Leighton, obviously.
Thank you.
And she had the headband and just she was like, "hi."
And, oh, you know, I'm like, if this girl can act, she's got the part.
- Uhh!
(Chuckles) - Break a leg. I think I just did.
More than anything, I just wanted to work.
I could've never expected that I would be able to play a character for six years that's so well-written and really challenging and great.
We really believed in all the various pairings and the chemistry and that, you know,
Blair and Serena feel like best friends.
I still miss Dan sometimes. The only thing lamer than dating Dan Humphrey is mourning Dan Humphrey.
The Humphrey family, we felt, had this great warmth, chemistry.
She might be a tad overwhelmed by the glitz and the glamour of the Humphrey lifestyle.
Nate Archibald is this kind of lost rich kid.
Do you ever feel like our whole lives have been planned out for us?
And, you know, Chuck Bass who, at the time, was pure villainy.
I love freshmen. Anything about her on "Gossip Girl"?
Nuh-uh.
Hmm, till you're done with her. ♪
When we shot the pilot, we all lived in the same hotel together for those few weeks.
And New York City... oh, it was the most incredible place in... in the world.
It was a fantastic feeling, you know, because everybody felt equally, um, as excited, um, and probably a bit nervous.
You know, you felt like you were kind of thrown into something together. It basically is, like, the best of all possible excuses to be in New York and live in New York.
It was so fun to see these kids who kind of showed up in, like, their uggs and in their hoodies figure out this world.
(Josh) We're shooting at the Palace Hotel.
Nobody really cares. No one's stopping to watch.
And I remember it was such a difference, like, the day after the show had premiered.
And then suddenly, like, there were people standing around, kinda watching.
And we were like, "oh. This is cool." There was, you know, a fair amount of press and expectations, and we didn't do that well.
13 episodes into our order, the writers' strike happened, and, you know, all production stopped.
And everything was repeating, and a lot of people watched "Gossip Girl" in repeats.
We're actually trying to work things out.
Today's our first day hanging out together alone.
We actually came back with a great audience and sort of wider interest than we had had when we started because that sort of "addictive" quality of the show had kind of kicked in.
(Man) Please welcome Blake Lively!
(Cheers and applause)
"Gossip Girl" was invited to do a panel at the Paley Festival that first year, and that felt really great.
It felt like they had caught on that there was something about the show that audiences were really reacting to.
Then you were like, uh,
"okay, if the wheels don't come off of this train, we're gonna be fine," and it kept going.
Every time we... we got renewed for another season, it was, um, selfish personally 'cause we're like,
"yes! We get to live in New York another year, and we get... get paid for it!"
(Whispers) Don't tell! (Laughs)
I think at first, critics were kind of like,
"this is a silly show about teenagers," but then the people who are actually from that world kind of validated it and embraced it, and it kind of forced people to take a second look.
I'm really happy to be here with you right now.
Nobody's ever looked at me the way you just did.
I hate you.
I've never hated anyone more.
Every nerve ending in my body is electrified by hatred.
There is a fiery pit of hate burning inside me, ready to explode.
(My fiction) * oh, oh, I... (Moans) ♪
The show was pretty controversial when it came on.
Excuse me. The liquor's just a chaser.
We were always getting in trouble for kind of pushing the envelope too far, from parents television association then watch groups.
Aah!
We tried to push it. Damn that mother-chucker.  It is a little bit out of hand.
Step any closer and I'll scream. You better believe you will.
I hope you did your yoga. This could go on a while.
You can't really watch the show with your family.
Or I... (Laughs) I can't.
Topless on Valentino's yacht. (Blake) Serena's been a... a bit too scandalous.
Stop talking and start partying.
(Mackintosh Braun's "Made for us" playing)
Definitely we've had some great, uh, milestones on "Gossip Girl", in terms of feeling, like, cultural permeation is happening.
Magazine covers... when they started coming, that felt very special.
"New York" magazine put us on the cover as the best show ever.
There was an asterisk... (Laughs) qualifying that, but it still said that.
(Ed) We've done wonderful shoots together.
I mean, it was my first experience doing anything like that, and they were fantastic, funny days.
We got name-checked by Obama.
Obama name-checked the show? What?! What, is... is he on, like, uh, "Gossip Girl" or something?
(Cheers and applause) That's pretty huge.
Camera set. Print it.
(Stephanie) We've also had some pretty intense crowd situations, just in terms of the actors getting mobbed and just knowing that now we have to have security on the set.
(Camera shutter clicking) (Ed) One of the first times we shot down on Central Park South, outside the Plaza, all of a sudden we just had, like, these crowds of people.
That was a strange thing.
(Kaylee) It was very surreal for me.
I don't think I was aware of what a big deal the show was until I was in it.
A book written about you guys.
It sounds exciting.
(Michelle) There was literally, like, 40 paparazzi and 200 just girls screaming and gathered around our trailers.
They liked to pet my hair, which is very strange. ♪ (Penn) I remember the first year when we first saw our pictures on a building.
And I was just like... come on.
(Laughs)
It was crazy there for a minute. I remember penn grabbed me.
He's like, "man, I've never had my head, like, on a billboard, you know?"
It was just so novel, you know, and just such a cool time.
(Kisses) Oh!
(Penn) To be 20 years old, to not be broke, and, uh, to be sharing it with, like, six other kids going through the same thing, there's very literally nothing like it.
(Woman) And to your left! Everyone, to your left!
(Penn) And there's just, like, parties constantly and, like, tinted windows and lights and, like, clothes that were given to you, and it's just like,
Who... what... what's going on right now?" (Screaming)
I think they had their fun.
They've gotten to see New York in a way that maybe only their characters could understand.
I just wish that they would leave me alone. Oh. Is that why you got your hair blown out?
(Laughs) (Camera shutters click) ♪
We have some of the most passionate, vocal fans, I think, uh, in the history of television.
My Twitter feed is often just a war between Dan and Blair shippers and Chuck and Blair shippers.
So it's just "Dair" vs. "Chair" in a battle royale. You kissed me back.
I felt it. It doesn't matter what you think you felt.
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
Even when we were doing "the O.C.," there was only, like, one or two web sites where fans would post comments.
And since then, the fan community and the online community has just grown, and certainly "Gossip Girl" has been a part of that.
(Penn) We would, like, walk out of our trailer for a second and a picture was taken of us, and immediately everything you're wearing, it's like, "get this there.
Get this there.
Get this there. Get this there. Also, he looks like (Bleep)."
You know? (Laughs) Or "he looks tired.
Why are you still following me, Nate?
Having to kiss Chace out in front of the Plaza Hotel, having thousands of teenage girls crying at me, screaming at me, "no!"
Like, "why?!" (Laughs)
I mean, that's what I was talking about.
Our fans were actually a lot older than people originally thought.
We hear about people in their 20s, in their 30s, in their 40s...
I mean, I can't tell you how many people come up to me and say,
"I know I'm not the target demographic, but I love the show." My grandparents still...
I get texts from nammy sometimes saying, "I don't like you with that M.I.L.F. anymore."
Is this the master bedroom?
Let's destroy it.
And I'm like,
"nammy! Watch your mouth!" I hope she sees this.
My best friend was right. Saying "yes" makes everything better.
Or no! I'm sorry. It wasn't "M.I.L.F." I take it all back.
It was "cougar." Now this is really gonna get me in trouble. It was "cougar."
- Nice to meet you, by the way, um... - Nate. Mm.
Uh, and you are?
Done now.
- Where's Serena?
- She's onstage. But I have her dress.
You mean, Serena's on the runway of Eleanor Waldorf's show in a design not made by Eleanor Waldorf?
(Inhales deeply) Oh, dear. ♪ Now please be gone, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh ♪
Eric Daman, our costume designer, has done an amazing job since the pilot of really being able to express characters through costume and build not just great fashion moments over episodes but real iconic identities for each of the characters.
Exquisite.
You exceeded even my high expectations.
I feel like the clothing really is kind of the characters' coat of arms, and when they put on their clothes, it kind of helps them become the character.
Like when Leighton walks in, she couldn't be any more different than who Blair Waldorf is, and she's like,
"when I put on my headband, I am Blair Waldorf." I'll take that.
Thank you.
Even with hair and makeup, it's the difference of putting on this outfit that Blair would only put together, and that brings the character to life even more.
Blake...
I think it's a much more symbiotic relationship where Blake inspires Serena, and Serena inspires Blake.
This girl has it.
People that wear these clothes have to be very bold and very confident and very wealthy, and so Eric really helps us create our characters with that.
I'd ask how you are, but I don't really care. I mean, I...
I'd say I'm great. Look at my hair, my clothes, my body.
It gives you a... a body language.
It gives you a... a posture that only that particular character can walk with.
And, you know, when you're in 7-inch heels, you're walking differently than when you're in sneakers.
And we also have so many places to wear... (Laughs) all these clothes!
Move!
I have a Humphrey to squash. They really go to a lot of parties.
I'm always dressing in these amazing party outfits.
Every episode, there's a brilliant gala or, you know, seeing Blair in her prom dress or Ed in his croquet outfit in the Hamptons.
It's sort of glamorous in a way that... that old Hollywood used to be glamorous, where people really dressed.
I think my most favorite outfit to date has been my debutante dress.
Who are you wearing? - Badgley Mischka. - It's great.
My fashion was... was... was more, you know, sailing on a yacht.
You know, like...
like... like a Nautica ad. What's with the business formal?
Are you being arraigned for something?
And actually, I would always love to see what Ed stepped out wearing.
You know, in the beginning, it was way more ridiculous.
You know, yellow socks and, like, his ascots and the whole thing.
(Josh) The Chuck Bass scarf evolution into ascot into wide cravat.
(Laughs) Uh... - I like your use of "cravat." - Why, thank you, Stephanie.
I wouldn't have learned "cravat" if it wasn't for my time on "Gossip Girl."
It's quite a sad story, actually, because I'm a big fan of ascots, and I had one before the show started and I can't really wear them anymore.
I will always go back to what Chuck Bass was wearing on the day that he tried to play basketball.
Let's just play some ball.
(Laughs) That was truly, truly epic.
Of course, the hundredth episode,
Blair's princess wedding was, you know,
I think it's one of the most beautiful weddings on television.
Is everything okay in here, Blair?
You are an artist.
(Eric) Working with Vera Wang, to go into her showroom and actually to be able to work with her on a one-to-one basis and, like, see all of these amazing dresses... you know, the amazing team of assistants that really helped me get in all these Philip Treacy hats, and we really worked our butts off to make that look just right.
Now if we can continue... to be on a television show that had access to all the best fashion in the world, and then to learn from the best... not just through Eric Daman but the designers that we got to meet.
I heard Marc Jacobs named a purse after her.
- (Woman) Whoo! - (Man) Love you!
A lot of them have become fashion icons.
Most of them are on the covers of magazines or doing perfume ads or, you know, we see them everywhere.
(Michelle) He definitely taught me how to accessorize, particularly in this last season during our fittings.
Eric and I are just like, "a necklace and earrings and a cuff and... and rings and studded necklace and studded... " We're just like,
"is that too much? No, put another thing on."
Welcome to the Upper East Side. ♪
This is Isaac Mizrahi. Zee!
Zoe! Okay, Alexa, it's your turn. (Chuckles nervously)
(Stephanie) We've been really, really lucky in the way that fashion has been a part of the show and then we've been able to benefit from that and get the fashion community to help us out
- and be a part of it. - (Josh) And appear on the show.
Thank you so much for seeing me on short notice.
You came highly recommended by Anna Wintour.
So then Eric finds himself having to dress, you know, big designers.
Michael Kors was easy
'cause he wears his black T-shirt and his black blazer.
Didn't go so well for those who showed up at Blair's birthday party, huh?
(Laughs) Uhh!
(Rachel gasps) (Thud) (Stephanie) Especially for Rachel Zoe, who had a chocolate fountain poured on her head.
(Women gasp)
She wore that beautiful cobalt blue Gucci dress, and we covered it in chocolate syrup.
I die.
I think they've been intelligent with guests stars and with references.
Isn't that Alexandra Richards? People from the art community and socialites... it's kind of funny to see them "in their element" but they're so not in their element, and check with them if we're doing it right.
This is Tinsley Mortimer.
Cyndi Lauper?!
And this is Sloane Crosley, the best-selling author of "I was told there'd be cake."
I think that was wonderful.
It gave a sense of, um, authenticity to the stories and to the world. Everyone's talking about it.
When we were doing the ballet episode,
I don't know anything about the ballet, so I was just sort of like,
"tell me who the ballet people are and let's invite them."
They're called ballerinas.
(Laughs)
The limo's taking me back in an hour.
Oh, you're not going to the White Party? Come on, pretty girls in white dresses.
Unless there's a sprinkler, I don't care. ♪
I think you're always looking to up the ante, so it started out as the Hamptons.
That was a really exciting opportunity.
Going to the Hamptons was a lot of fun,
like doing the White Party and being in this whole other world.
Every time we get to go outside of New York, it really just adds something extra special.
(Brakes screech)
Nate? ♪
We kind of wanted to see Serena and Nate in the California sunshine.
(Nate and Chuck) Cheers.
(Clink) We were down in the marina, and Chuck had won a yacht over the course of the summer.
And he was riding a motorcycle on Mulholland.
Not well. (Laughs)
- He wasn't riding it well. - Not well. We were at a great mid-century house in the Hollywood Hills.
So to really kind of give L.A. The "Gossip Girl" treatment was fun.
(Pops) Aah!
Hello! (Gasps)
Of course that happened! (Laughs) ♪
Paris was, like, the ultimate.
That's been Stephanie's dream since she was a wee lass. (Laughs) "Ooh, la la!
Paris is burning, and Serena and Blair lit the match."
Of course your flame is hotter than mine.
We had been warned beforehand that the show's not very popular in Paris.
Um, it might even be canceled, and we were like, well, that is a little embarrassing, but we also don't really care
'cause we wanna go to Paris and shoot the show, and our audience will enjoy seeing that.
But it was bananas. (Girls screaming) Aah!
The number of people that came out to watch and wait up all night at, like, a dirty train station just see Ed or Leighton for, like, five seconds... (Josh) It was crazy.
You would just hear, like, all these French girls yelling... (Imitates French accent) Leighton!
Leighton!
(Normal voice) And, you know, Ed Westwick... he literally could not leave his hotel or anything.
And what we found out was, these French teenagers were watching the show online also.
Au revoir.
They weren't gonna wait a year for the show to come out on French TV.
I think Paris felt like "Gossip Girl" was its own as well.
You know, not just... it didn't just belong to New York anymore.
It belonged to Paris as well.
Blair, come meet Lou Doillon.
- Bonjour. - Bonjour. Oh, well, that trip to Paris...
I still relive that week daily. (Chuckles)
This is Chuck we're talking about. He really could just disappear.  If you're so torn up about it, stop him.
You and I both know you're the only one that can do that.
(Eric) For me, one of the most beautiful moments in the show is when Blair Waldorf runs through the Gare Saint-Lazare in that orange Oscar de La Renta dress, and there's just this dark, old, beautiful train station.
But to have this pop of orange gown, that really just came together and was scintillating.
Your world would be easier if I didn't come back.
(Voice breaks) That's true... (Sniffles) but it wouldn't be my world without you in it.
♪ (Stephanie) We really think about the music that goes in the show.
Alex Patsavas, our music supervisor, is all over that.
And our editors are all huge music fans, too.
And our cast. We've used Leighton's song. We've used Ed's band.
We've used Taylor.
- Most of our cast has record deals... - (Laughs) so that makes it easier for us. So you go to things like this every week?
(Stephanie) Blake was a huge Florence + The Machine fan.
No Doubt reuniting, having Lady Gaga on,
- to right as that was all happening.
- Mm-hmm.
And of course Sonic Youth. ♪ Spinning eams and angel wings ♪
Sonic Youth was great 'cause first of all, they're probably, like, my favorite band in the whole world, and sometimes you just have to do something for yourself.
And they ended up showing up for Rufus and Lily's wedding, which was really special, and then doing an original version of "Star Power" just for the show. ♪ Star power, star power ♪ over me
We always wanted the show to be able to function like a magazine.
So if you wanted to find out what's a new fashion designer or what are the trends, what's the song that I should be listening to, what's the place that I should go, you could read a bunch of magazines or go online and figure that out, or you could just watch "Gossip Girl" and that information would be delivered to you.
Doesn't really play without the other Ramones.
I was gonna do Iggy but I thought it might scare the children.
Oh, so prom tomorrow night.
What do you say we stay in, watch some scary movies? - The scarier the better. - Absolutely.
Yesterday, they were tearing down the Humphrey loft, and that was the first time that... that it really felt like, wow, this is... this is actually coming to an end.
It was sad, man. All my Lincoln Hawk records are off the walls and all these photos that we all contributed to, to make up this family.
Where's the couch from the Humphrey loft?
It was blue and it was suede and it was quilted and it was quite lovely.
I would like the Humphrey jukebox... (Laughs) 'cause I feel like it's loaded 'with early '90s hits...
Yeah.
From... from the time of Lincoln Hawk's reign.
We've talked about stealing things.
We've all tried. I kinda want to take that, the statue there.
We call it "Chuck Brass."
Or I'd like to take the pool table, but I'd have to get Chace to carry it on his back.
I think I'll just take my memories.
You know? It's beautiful.
(Stephanie) I wouldn't mind Blair's necklace from Paris or the Harry Winston ring, which, literally, when I asked the Harry Winston man if I could try it on my finger, he said, "no."
It comes with two armed security guards.
(Laughs) - So that's the only...
- And a German Shepherd. There are so many pieces of wardrobe.
I used to make a file of pieces that I really love, and at the very end of the show,
I was gonna be really bold and ask for them.
But then the file was getting too long, and I was just embarrassed, so I...
I gave that one up. ♪
Take number one.

You know, we've all had such a... a great, positive experience.

I mean, they were teenagers.
It's so much fun.
(Laughs) (Woman) * you are the switch (josh) Steph and I always talk about, you know, she feels like the mom, I feel like the dad.

We won't miss the early hours, but we will miss the... the excuse just to, you know, hang out with each other between takes and catch up.

It's the crew.
We've had the same crew for six years, and they are also my... my very best friends. ♪ So ♪
A lot of the guest stars say,

I'm kind of looking at everyone and thinking, oh, my God, everyone's grown up.
No one in high school reads "Gossip Girl" anymore. It's for old people.

What can I say except, uh, welcome to adulthood. ♪ So
We're all very excited to see what's next for ourselves and for each other.
You know, I'm looking forward to watching people that I've worked with for six years now flourish and grow. ♪ Ooh
We learned who we were together.
We're all going through that heightened reality together.
Um, and keeping each other sane, I think, through that.
I know that it has changed my life in a lot of ways, but it hasn't changed me.
It's only made me appreciate everything else in my life that's still really concrete and the same even more.
(Stephanie) I've taken away so much from "Gossip Girl."
I've had so many amazing memories of being in incredible places that, you know, when I was a kid, I only saw in books.
It's sad that it's coming to an end, but we've had just a blast.
From the beginning of time...
"Gossip Girl" time, that is...
I think people have wanted to know, you know, what's gonna happen with Chuck and Blair?
Will you go to war with me?
I thought you'd never ask. (Clink)  Serena... will she ever find fulfillment?
I invited you into my home, Dan, and my world, a... and then you just humiliate me.
Her relationship with Dan in the beginning of show was so key. Will that ever come back into play?
Some of the old faces that were on the show, will we ever see them again?
Who is Gossip Girl? Unmasking Gossip Girl? That's a major media coup.
If you were a loyal viewer or if you haven't watched the show in a few years, you're not gonna wanna miss this episode and you're definitely not gonna wanna miss the last ten minutes. - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com...

(WHOOPlNG) Bravo! Bravo!
(CHEERlNG)
You were great. I'm so proud of you.
You were wonderful.
Grandpa and I thought you were wonderful.
Excuse me, I'm sorry. It's just... I have to have your autograph.
- Dad. No. - What, you were incredible.
- No, stop it. - What?
- I messed up some of my lines. - No, you didn't. I didn't notice.
- Did you notice? - I didn't notice at all.
Honey, you were great. What?
Mom, can I go see The Lion King this weekend?
- There's a class trip, everyone's going. - Did you ask your father?
- Can I, Dad? - Yeah, sure. I got some money.
Well, it's $130.
But we're staying overnight and that includes hotel and everything.
Okay, great. Yeah.
(PHONE RlNGS)
- Yeah. - Hey, man. Can I talk to you?
- ANDY: Where are you? - I'm down the hall, by the coffee.
- How about my office, 30 seconds? - HANK: All right.
Hank, the super at 111 Riverside says the boiler's really kaput.
He needs you to... Hello?
So?
- That place that you were talking about. - What place?
- The one that we were going to...
- To knock off?
Yeah.
To rob?
You say it.
Tell me about it.
I'm not going to tell you about it until you say you're in and once you say it, there's no way out.
I'm in.
Let me see your hands.
- Just say it again, "I'm in." - What're you talking about?
Just say it again, "I'm in."
I'm in.
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)
What?
I just wanted to see if you were pulling any of that chickenshit baby stuff
like when we were kids, you know,
"It doesn't count. I had my fingers crossed."
I'm in. What're we doing?
- And when? - It's a jewelry store.
- Does this ring a bell? - No.
What if I tell you it's got a Foot Locker on one side and a Claire's Accessories on the other.
Yeah, that's right. You got it. Now, listen.
We don't want Tiffany's.
We want a Mom and Pop operation, in a busy place, on a Saturday when the week's takes go in the safe.
We both worked there. We know the safe combinations.
We know the burglar alarm signals. We know where everything is.
I figure, between the week's take, the jewelry and the cases, the vault, there's a $500,000 haul.
I figure probably six.
That old dumb old lady that works there, she's alone till noon.
She's not going to be a problem.
Andy.
Yeah?
That's Mom and Dad's store.
That's what I said.
A Mom and Pop operation.
- You can't do that. - Yeah, we can. Think about it.
It's perfect. It's perfect.
In and out in a minute.
Insurance takes care of Mom and Dad, so they're not hurt. Right?
No one's going to give a shit.
After a week the cops
- will put it in the back of the filing cabinet. - Jesus, Andy. I...
Why did you even want me in on this?
Well, it'll solve everything for both of us.
What has to be solved for you?
Same as you. I need money. I'm going to start over again.
What do you mean?
What the fuck kind of... It's none of your business.
I just want out. I just want to... That's all.
I'm getting out, I want to help my little brother.
Come on.
Yeah.
No, I don't think I can do this. I don't think I can...
Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can.
I just...
That's $2,000.
It's an advance.
See what just that much does for you.
And, imagine the rest.
HANK: Five, six, seven, eight, nine hundred dollars.
You still owe me May and June.
Yeah, Monday. All right. Everything on Monday.
- That's what I said. - Such a loser.
You're such a fucking loser.
I come over here with $900.
- Yeah, well, if it was for me, maybe. - And I'm the fucking... All right.
- May and June, asshole. - Bye, bye, bye.
Danielle, dinner.
No, please don't put me on... Jesus.
- Yo, Bobby. - What's going on?
- Hey, here, let me buy you a drink. - I'm working.
- I ain't loaning you no more money. - No, come on, man. I'm flush.
- You don't exactly...
- Yeah, something like that.
Look, you just... If you're free tomorrow morning,
I got a proposition for you.
- Later. - All right.
- What if there is a security guard? - There isn't.
- Why? - No, it's a Mom and Pop place.
Who ever heard of a Mom and Pop jewelry store?
- What the fuck is that? - It's in the suburbs, all right.
It's not in the city.
I don't know.
We drive out there, we check it out, if anything looks off, you know, we just drive away.
We say, "Fuck it," we drive our happy asses home and I keep the money anyway.
Yeah, fine.
You keep the money anyway.
- Hanson? - Yeah, that's me.
All right.
- Yeah. - Bobby, for Christ's sakes,
- Bobby, we got to go. - Just come on in.
I just got to throw on some clothes. It'll only take a second.
We got to go.
- (SHUSHlNG) Just give me a second. - God damn it.
Jesus Christ, Bobby, it's so fucking early.
Boo wakes up, you fucking sit up with him.
- I told you it was work. - I don't give a fuck what it is.
Chris ain't used to getting up this early.
Oh, Christ.
Come on, babe. Here.
- Thank you, baby. - Yeah, just keep it down, okay?
You wake Boo up, I'll kick your ass.
- All right. - Yours, too.
All right.
Come on.
All right, let's do it.
(MUSlC PLAYlNG ON RADlO)
- BOBBY: Are we there? - No.
All right.
(LAUGHS)
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?
Look, I used to work there, all right.
I used to work there and I can't take a chance on being recognized. Don't...
Look... (BOBBY LAUGHlNG)
- You ain't never done this before, huh? - Yeah, so?
I got to tell you something, you look like a fucking asshole.
- Yeah, all right, look...
- I'm going to do this on my own.
- Really? - You do the driving, I do the thing, all right.
- What if you need help? - I got all the help I need.
There's no shooting.
- I ain't looking for it. - There's no shooting.
- You do the driving. - Hey.
- I do the thing. - No shooting.
You ain't got the balls to do the thing. I got the balls
- and I got a gun. That's the deal. - Listen, no shooting.
- Or else I'm leaving right now. - Hey, no!
Just no shooting, okay?
(FOLK MUSlC PLAYlNG ON RADlO)

- He sounds like some nut case. - Okay.
- But... - All right, I'll take it.
It just came apart, Andy.
HANK: Oh, my God, Andy.
What the fuck am I gonna do?
No, honey, no, don't worry. It's just some mistake.
It's either the bank's or mine.
Maybe I didn't put enough money in the joint account.
Yeah. No. Listen, don't worry.
Of course, we have the cash. I'll call, I'll take care of it. Okay?
Yes, okay?
(KNOCKlNG ON DOOR)

We're waiting for you in the conference room.
Okay, I'll be right in.
Jesus.
Okay, next.
The auditors.
Some of you guys might have heard, we're getting hit with an IRS audit.
The auditors will be here on Monday.
They'll spend a day or two with each department.
On Monday, they'll start with payroll, so you're up first, Andy.
Great. Great. No problem.
MAN: How are you doing today, sir?
Thanks a lot.
(DOORBELL RlNGlNG) (TV BLARlNG)
Hungry?
Have a drink.
Right, tonic water.
You know, the thing about real estate accounting is that you can, you can head down the page or across the page, and everything works out.
So, every day, everything adds up.
Well, the total is always the sum of its parts.
It's clean, it's clear, neat, absolute.
But my life, it...
It doesn't add up. It's...
Nothing connects to anything else. It's...
I'm not the sum of my parts.
All of my parts don't add up to one...
To one me, I guess.
Get a shrink or a wife.
- I got a wife. - Get a shrink.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Was it me, honey?
What difference does it make?
It's another strikeout.
I swear it would make a lot of difference.
- You're all I want. - Yeah, well...
I'm a lousy cook. The house looks like shit.
I'm a lousy lay, I don't know why you wanna keep me.
You weren't in Rio.
I wasn't what?
Lousy lay.
Well, like you said, just blame it on Rio.
Suppose I could get us back there.
What?
Rio.
- To live? - Absolutely.
- You're just crazy. Crazy. - No.
The real estate market's booming in Rio. There's a lot of new money.
And they're going to want the same as Europeans, Arabs, everybody wants real estate in New York, in America and I know the market here.
You don't even speak the language.
I'll fucking learn it. Jesus Christ.
You know when...
When you met me, my biggest prospect was inheriting a Mom and Pop jewelry store in a fucking shopping mall in Westchester.
Now, I know it's not Trump Plaza, and...
But just take a look at how we're living now.
Now, I took that lousy job in that, that real estate office, I was practically a fucking gofer, and I'm pulling down six figures now.
I know the angles.
- Yeah. - Yeah.
I bet you do.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Well, because there is no extradition agreement between Brazil and the United States.
How the...
How the hell do you know that?
I saw it in a movie.
(LAUGHlNG)
Yeah, I guess I saw the same movie.
So, what are you thinking? What are you thinking?
What are you thinking? What are you thinking?
Don't ask, don't tell.
I just want us to get back there.
I've seen Heaven, Gina, it's a nice place to stay.
- Okay? All right? - Uh-huh.
- What language do they speak there? - Portuguese.
I speak a little Spanish.
(LAUGHS)
That's... I'm sorry, sweetheart, that's not the same language.
- Yes, it is. - I'm sorry, it's not.
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is. - No.
- Yes, it is. - Cómo se llama?
- Me llamo... - Cómo? Me llamo...
Gina.
(ELECTRONlC BUZZlNG)
Why'd you come to me?
I know you from way back, I know what you do.
You're a cop.
No, I'm not a cop, I just want to make sure you're still around.
I'll bring you what I've got soon, either you take it or you don't.
But I know you will.
You could work for the cops.
Check me out.
I'll be back.
(ELECTRONlC BUZZlNG)
That's $2,000.
It's an advance.
See what just that much does for you, and imagine the rest.
(LAUGHlNG)
- Yeah, so how do we start? Oh, fuck.
- It's not we, you.
Me?
What the hell do I know about robbing a jewelry store?
You'll learn it there. On-the-job training, you know.
Cut it out, man, this is serious.
You know, I'm serious as a heart attack. Listen, number one, I can't...
- I can't go up to the mall. - Why not?
Oh God, three months ago,
I had to walk the whole goddamn area with a Home Depot representative,
'cause they were thinking of buying up a lot of space.
We own a lot of land in the mall, and I'm getting a lot of big handshakes.
"I haven't seen you in so long since you left."
And telling me all that bullshit because they figure I'm making a killing, because a big chain wants to buy them out.
I'm saying someone's going to just recognize me too easy.
So we postpone, just...
Yeah, we could, you know, wait a year.
I mean, I don't know about you, my problems are pressing.
Jesus, Andy, I... Andy!
- I wouldn't even know how to start, I mean. - Well, you can stop being a baby.
- I'm not being a...
- Yeah, you're being a baby.
Get a gun. You get a toy gun in a kid's store.
Right, that old lady that works on Saturday, what's her name?
- Doris? - Yeah, Doris, Mom's friend.
She's what, 60, 70? She's blind as a bat?
Look at me. Blind as a bat.
All right, those toy guns, they look so real, they fool cops all the time.
All right, you go in at 8:00 a.m., just as she opens up.
You put her old ass in the back room, you empty the vault, the cash, the trays and you dump it in a fucking sack.
All right. You don't gotta be neat about it.
Jesus, Andy, I don't know. I don't know, I don't... I...
I don't know.
Okay. Come on.
You can do it.
You can do it.
Anybody can.
- I just think...
- I know, I know. It's too late to think.
It's too late.
This is our future.
Okay.
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
- Yeah. - WOMAN: There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.
He sounds like some nut case. But...
Okay, I got it.
It just came apart, Andy.
Oh, my God, Andy.
HANK: What the fuck am I gonna do?
HANK: Could he be in a different wing?
If you just pipe down a second, sir, I'm trying to help you.
- What are you doing here? - Keep quiet one minute.
Dad called me, all right. I just got here.
- This lady, she doesn't...
- Look, Miss, our father... I got it.
- I got it. I know, but you might...
- I told him, we've got no Charles Hanson.
Wait a minute, I got a Nanette Hanson.
- What? - There's a Nanette Hanson.
- Brought in about three hours ago. - What?
Gunshot wounds.
- Where is she? - Emergency ICU.
Hey. Now. Hey, hold it.
Dad?
(SlGHlNG)
She's unconscious.
And they...
She's...
They...
They say...
MARTHA: So, how are you feeling?
Yeah, I feel old.
I've been studying all week, and I can't retain a thing.
Come on, you're going to pass with flying colors, Dad.
That's how I'm going to spend my birthday, taking that stupid test.
Have you spoken to your brothers?
Few weeks ago.
CHARLES: Yeah? How are they?
Busy.
You know, Dad, Hank is Hank and Andy's Andy.
No more cramming, birthday boy. It's the moment of truth.
What time is Doris coming to the store?
She said 12:00 at the latest.
She has to baby-sit for her daughter.
I'll pick you up right after my test.
Come on, come on.
All right, all right, all right.
- Perfect score, Mr. Hanson. - Bingo!
(LAUGHlNG)
Congratulations.
If you'll take this to Window C, they'll give you the eye test.
I might not do so well on that one.
- I've been studying hard, of course. Thanks. - All right.
(CHATTER ON POLlCE RADlO)
That's my store!
- What happened? What's happening? - POLlCEMAN:
- Sir, sir, just stay behind the yellow line. - What's happening?
- I want to know what's happening. - Behind the yellow line.
- Where's my wife? Where's my wife? - Calm down.
(HEART MONlTOR BEEPlNG)
I love you.
There are more tests we can do, but from what we've seen so far, it's very unlikely.
There's no brain activity.
And statistically speaking, there's very little chance for recovery.
ANDY: Why was Mom working?
I thought she didn't work at the store anymore, that's what Katherine told me.
Doris had to baby-sit, I had to get down to the DMV, get my eyes tested.
Today's my birthday.
Where's your brother?
He...
He says he can't take it. To let him know if...
If he can help, but he just can't see her like that.
He's 28 years old.
He's a goddamn punk from Red Hook.
Red Hook. What was he doing up here? What in the fucking world?
I mean, did he put a map on the wall and throw a dart?
It's so absurd. It's so goddamn arbitrary.
Why me? Why her?
What was this goddamn kid doing?
You belong in hell.
Yeah. I understand. All right.
Look, it might be better if you call, make an appointment?
Well, I'd rather wait.
Please. Steve...
Dad.
You have to make a decision, Dad.
The gun was bought in Texas.
Stolen Texas driver's license, his ID, fake, the gun turns up in New York, a year later.
- Mom needs you to make a decision, Dad. - Andy, just leave him alone.
Well, something has to be done, he has to make a decision.
Just leave him to his grief for one minute.
- Mom is in the hands of Jesus. - Now, will you cut it out with that crap?
You shouldn't push Dad to make a decision he doesn't wanna make.
Well, he has to make a decision.
Hey, Patrick.

Let her go.

"Receive her, we pray, into the mansions of the saints.
"As we make ready our sister's resting place
"Look also with favor on those who mourn.
"And comfort them in their loss.
"Because God has chosen to call Nanette from this life,
"commit her body to the earth, for we are dust and to dust we shall return."
I'm so sorry for your loss. She was a wonderful person.
- She was a wonderful woman. - Yes.
- I'm so sorry. - You have my deepest condolences.
She was a dear friend.
So sorry for your loss, your mother was a good person.
I'm so sorry.

Yeah, good morning, Sergeant.
I've been trying to reach Detective Barrett but he doesn't return my calls.
Would you like to leave a message, sir?
No, I wouldn't like to leave another message.
Doesn't anyone down there give a damn?
Doesn't anyone down there work for a living?
Would you like to leave a message, sir?
Don't you know how important this is to me?
I know, I just...
You know, I thought I was going to be able to work it out, but...
But I couldn't get the money together, you know.
All my friends think I'm going to be there, what am I going to tell them?
You know, I mean, there's going to be other field trips.
Not to The Lion King, there won't.
Look, Dad, if you weren't going to pay for it, you should have just said so and saved me the humiliation of having to tell all my friends that you're a loser.

No, no. No, mid-size is fine, sir.
No.
Thank you for calling.

Yeah, I got a message from Mike Steuben.
Apparently I left something in a vehicle that I returned last Saturday.
Oh, well, you would talk to Mr. Steuben, then. He's the manager.
Yeah, I know, so could I speak with him?
I'm sorry, he's not here. You'll have to come back.

CHRlS: That's the guy, that's him.
Yo, buddy.
- This guy? - Yeah.
You were with Bobby Lasorda, Saturday?
- What? - I asked you a fucking question.
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What's your name? - I'm Hank.
- Hank what? - You know what?
Come. Why don't you... Let's go.
Follow me, we can talk over here.
- Come on. Have a seat. - Is this all right?
Yeah, this is perfect.
So...
What's the deal, huh?
- My sister is quite all of a sudden a widow. - Yeah.
She says you and Bobby had some work.
Bobby said it was work.
Work that involved him getting shot and killed, but not you getting shot and killed.
No, I just got him the car.
- I'm so sorry. - What the fuck does that mean?
Well, Bobby said that he needed to rent a car, but that he...
This was Friday night and he didn't have a credit card, so I told him that I would rent him a car.
And I owed him some money. You know. That's it, I swear.
I'm so sorry.
- So what? You're lying. - No, I'm not.
Because if Bobby wanted a car, he would have fucking stolen one.
Chris, go fucking wait outside.
Let me handle this.
You got a driver's license?
- A what? - You know, the...
The driver's license you show when you rent a car?
Yeah.
- Let me see it. - Yeah.
All right, sure.
Here.
- Henry Hanson. - Yeah.
This is your address, right?
Yeah, sure.
I'm going to be straight with you, chico.
You mind if I call you chico?
People call me Hank.
Bobby was a piece of shit.
I know it, you know it. That's not the point.
The point is that piece of shit was the father of my sister's child.
And he was paying the bills.
And now he's dead.
And I'm thinking, who's going to pay all these bills?
I'm so sorry.
Sorry ain't going to pay the bills, chico.
I know, I know.
We need to negotiate a settlement, so make me an offer.
Ten grand, done.
It's 10 grand. I consider us even.
If you don't like 10, I can make it 15.
- No. - My sister wants me to kill you.
Or I could call the cops.
But I don't like cops.
And the cops ain't going to pay my sister's bills.
So, I think a settlement is pretty fair all-around.
- Day after tomorrow, chico. - Can I?
Here. 8:00.
You fucking crazy?
I was hoping that you had something left over from the settlement.
Lend you money? You owe me $2,000.
Shocked to shit you'd even ask.
Martha,
I'm in serious trouble.
I don't give a shit what kind of trouble you're in.
The next time you show up here, better be to pay me.
Listen, tell Danielle I love her.
If you loved her, you'd pay her fucking child support.

He was always such a baby.
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
GlNA: Yeah.
- Hey, Gina. - I can't really talk right now.
Andy needs me. I got to go.
Gina, Gina.
Excuse me, is Mike Steuben here?
- Not till noon, can I help you? - Yeah, yeah.
I returned a car last Saturday and I guess I forgot something.
Hanson?
That's right, Hanson. Yeah, and I'm pretty sure it was a CD.
Hang on.
Here we go, Mr. Hanson.
- Great. - I just need to see some ID.
Yeah, you know, I...
I lost my license.
You have a credit card, the one you used to rent the car with?
Yeah.
- Yeah, this one. - All right.
Okay, great.
- Thank you. - Take care.
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
- Hello? - ANDY: It's me.
Andy, Jesus! Fuck, man, we got problems.
(HEART MONlTOR BEEPlNG)
ON MACHlNE: Hi, Andy. This is Jake at the office.
Really sorry to bother you, but the auditors are coming tomorrow.
They've noticed a few problems.
It's pretty urgent, so give a call when you get this.
You're going to have to get some sleep tonight.
Have you given any thought to the store?
I mean, you're going to have to give it some consideration. It's just gonna...
I could open it up for you, you know, while you're at the hospital.
A few hours a day.
So people know you're still there.
I should burn the goddamn place down.
Andy, this is Jake.
Now I hope you're checking your messages because we have a real mess here.
JAKE: The auditors say that there's two terminated employees from your department still drawing checks.
And there's something about unpaid OASDI taxes.
Look, you need to call us...
I got to go to the office tomorrow.
There's a problem. I'll go in the morning. I should be back later.
Okay?
His mother's dying, and he's going back to work.
Yes!
Pick up the phone.
I know you're there, pick up the phone, you fucking faggot.
Andy, I'm here.
What are you doing here? You don't have an appointment.
- You know the deal, you can't just show up. - I know, I'm sorry.
Come back in an hour, tonic water.
My mom's dying.
Bummer.
Next time, make an appointment.
Stupid piece of shit.
Stop talking to me like that.
What the fuck?
Are you going to get tough?
Are you going to hurt me?
Why was there even a gun?
Why was there even a fucking gun?
I gave you all the information you needed. Why was Bobby Lasorda even there?
- Why the fuck? - I didn't think I could do it alone.
I should fucking kill you.
How are we going to fix it so your shit don't fall on my shoes?
So, think now, who else knows?
"Commit her body to the earth.
"For we are dust and to dust we shall return.
"But the Lord Jesus will change our mortal bodies to be like his in glory.
"So let us commend our sister to the Lord."
She hated it when I barbecued.
CHARLES: I'm sorry I wasn't able to be what you wanted me to be.
I've never been very good at talking about feelings or showing you that kind of affection or support.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to be the father you wanted.
But I guess I wanted you to be better than me.
And I thought that if I push...
It may not mean anything to you, but I want you to know that I really do love you.
And I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm just so sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be the son you wanted.
You did the best you could.
Still, yeah.
Manage to seem to still like Hank.
He was a lot more of a fuck-up than I was.
- He was the baby. - Yeah.
- He needed us more. - Yeah, he needed you more.
You sure it wasn't his cute looks or his puppiness?
You were the first.
The first always has it rougher.
Yeah, so I'm told.
You know, the four of you, I never felt like I was part of the club.
Beautiful birds of a feather.
You sure I'm your son?
Gina and I have got to get back to the city.
Andy?
My dad.
Andy.
(SOBBlNG)
Okay.
Why don't we pull over?
My dad.
Oh, God.
It's not fair! It's not fair!
All my life I've been afraid of becoming like him. All my life!
All my life with you, and it's not fair.
He can't just say he's sorry and make it all go away.
It's too late.
It's not that easy!
It's not fair! It's not fucking fair!
No, Dad.
Oh, God!
He can't do that!
Andy.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Andy.
- I'll be back in a bit. - Where are you going?
I'll be back soon, I just got to... I got to deal with some stuff.
What's going on?
What if you come home and I'm not here?
You got some place you got to be?
(DOOR SLAMMlNG)
Your boss called and he wants you to call him right away.
Are you in trouble?
They just miss me.
Where are you going?
Something has to change.
- What do you mean? - I mean that this just isn't working.
- What's not working? - The life that we have.
It was really bad before Rio and now it's even worse.
You never tell me anything that's going on anymore.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
What was that in the car yesterday?
I could help.
I don't need any help.
Do you realize that I've been having an affair?
What's that supposed to mean?
Means I've been fucking another guy.
Every Thursday, me and your brother, Hank. We get together and we fuck.
Not only that, he loves me.
And he still finds me attractive.
All the time.
Not just on vacation.
Hank?
Yeah, Hank.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Are you gonna get angry?
(EXCLAlMS IN ANNOYANCE)
- Where are you gonna go? - I was just gonna go to my mother's.
How're you gonna get there?
I was gonna take a cab.
I could really use some, some money.
I'll go to the bank later.
Here.

Come on.
(ELECTRONlC BUZZlNG)
Last person I ever thought I'd see again as long as I lived.
Charlie Hanson.
You're still a crook?
You come all this way to insult me?
Did you hear anything about a holdup at the Westchester Shopping Mall?
What would I know about Westchester?
That's just for upstanding citizens such as yourself.
Have you heard anything?
Why would I hear anything about anything? I sell diamonds.
- And fence them. - Never!
Did you hear of a young guy called Bobby Lasorda?
Wrong tree, Charlie.
A couple of punks shot my wife in a holdup. She's dead.
I'm sorry.
I don't give a shit about your little side business,
I don't care about anything anymore, except finding the guy who did this.
Do you know anything?
I remember when Charlie Hanson started out on the streets.
Young and cocky, good cutter. A long time ago, Charlie.
You always hated my guts, you called me a crook, but you didn't know shit about how the world works, or what some people will do for money.
I guess, now you know, Charlie.
The world is an evil place, Charlie.
Some of us make money off of that, and others get destroyed.
He walked in here, he looks a little bit like you, Charlie.
He walked in here and I almost knew him, right off the bat.
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
HANK: Hello.
It's me.
Andy, Jesus, man, we got problems.
What do you mean, problems?
Bobby's girlfriend's got a fucking brother, okay.
And the guy is blackmailing me, all right.
He said he's gonna go to the cops, all right, or kill me if I don't pay him $10,000.
All right, all right.
Just stay there, I'll be right over, I'll figure something out.
- Andy, this guy isn't fucking around. - All right, I'll figure something out.
Andy, Jake needs to see you.
They're all in the conference room with the IRS guys.
They're going all the way back
- through your accounts. - Just fuck 'em, I got to go to my dad's.
I'm gonna have to tell them you were here.
For God's sake, say something.
Okay.
We're in trouble.
The worst trouble imaginable. You're aware of that, right?
So, why don't we try and fix it?
There's almost no choice, but you're gonna have to follow my lead.
No questions, no hesitations.
I've done that before, all right, and that's how come I'm standing here, with my life going down the fucking toilet.
Fuck you, fuck you, I'll do it alone.
You can sit here and wait till you go to jail and take it up the ass for the rest of your fucking life.
Let's do it already, what's your idea?
Sorry, what's your idea?
What's Bobby's girlfriend's name?
Chris. Yeah, Chris.
Chris.
Call Chris, tell her to get her brother over to her apartment.
- What for? - We'll meet him.
He figures we owe him $10,000, we have to resolve it.
Resolve it how?
Play it by ear, see what happens, maybe we pay him.
He's never gonna let us off the hook.
All right, we're gonna be paying him back for the rest of our lives.
Hey, you finally figured out something for yourself.
Let's just get the money, see what happens.
Where are we gonna get $10,000?
No, that might be easier.
Call Chris.
ANDY: Taxi!
(GROANlNG)
Andy, Jesus Christ! You're gonna kill him.
Come on.
Shit.
(GUN FlRES)
Come on.
Hold the bag. Hold out the fucking bag!
Hold it open like this. Hold it open like that!
I got it, I got it.
- Oh, shit, do you want these? - Just put it in the bag!
Put it in the bag!
- Out. - Got it.
(GUN FlRES)
Oh, my God, Andy.
- Did you touch anything? - Did you go crazy?
- Did you touch anything? - Are you fucking nuts?
- Did you touch anything? - Wait, you didn't have to kill him, all right.
He's not gonna go to the cops. All right? He's a drug dealer.
Yeah, I guess he'll just go to some other dealers and suppliers and that's all we need, is 10 South Americans chasing us for the rest of our lives.
Did you touch anything?
I don't think so.
- You don't think so? - I don't think so, no!
- No, I didn't touch anything! - Think, God damn it, you think!
- I don't... I don't like this, Andy! - Did you touch anything?
- I don't like...
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Did you touch anything? - No.
Are we good?
Let's go.
You got the money, chico?
I don't like wasted trips.
You don't look happy.
Mind if I call you groucho?
(BABY CRYlNG)
ANDY: No, I don't mind.
- ANDY: Like what you're seeing? - Yeah, a lot.
- Stand up. Stand up! - All right, all right.
- Turn around. - All right, all right, all right.
So how we gonna do this?
Gladly pay you the money, got plenty of it.
How do we know you're not gonna bleed us for the next couple of months?
I just want enough to take care of Chris.
That's nice, my brother wouldn't take care of me like that.
Hey, what do you say, Chris, should I trust this guy?
- Yes. - Speak up. What?
Yes.
I don't think so.
(BABY WAlLING)
HANK: No, Andy, don't, don't, don't...
- What did you say? - No, you can't do that, I won't let you.
- You won't let me?
- No, no more, you kill her, you're gonna have to kill me.
Not such a bad idea.
You know, in fact, it's a pretty good one.
You know I know.
What do you know?
I know.
I'm sorry.
I fucked it all up.
Just do it.
Do it.
Go ahead.
Come on.
You'd be doing me a favor.
Come on.

If he's awake now, you can spend a couple of minutes with him.
ANDY: Dad?
I never meant to hurt her.
I just needed money.
There wasn't supposed to be any gun.
She wasn't supposed to be in the store. Everything just went wrong.
It's okay, Andy.
It's okay.

Let's work on your breathing.
Fear no good.

Breathing.

I can make it work for a while... ...but you need...
Okay.
Okay.
No, no, no. Shut that off.
Turn it off! Watch out!
Okay.
Martina.
No, wait.
Oh, that's not right.
You see that? You see that?
Our ticket out of here.
Damn it.
Here's something a bit more interesting.
It's possible gamma sickness.
Milwaukee.
A man drank one of those guarana sodas.
Guess it had a little more kick than he was looking for.
Where was it bottled? Porto Verde, Brazil.
Get our agency people looking for a white man at that bottling plant.
Tell them no contact.
If he even sees them, he's gone.
I got you what I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality. And I pulled you an ace.
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England... ...and on loan to SOCOM from the Royal Marines.
I know you're cashing some chips for this, Joe.
Glad I could help.
Just make it good. This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture. Have your dart clips and suppression ordinance, live fire is for backup only.
We got local out there, but we want it tight and quiet.
Is he a fighter?
Your target is a fugitive from the U.S. Government... ...and stole military secrets.
He is also implicated in the deaths... ...of two scientists, a military officer, an Idaho state trooper... ...and possibly two Canadian hunters, so don't wait to see if he's a fighter.
Trank him... ...and bring him back.
Oh, come on.
Gentlemen.
Here we go.
Get rid of the damn dog.
Take him.
Target's on the move.
Where is he?
- He's on the ground. - Let's go.
Go.
Move, move.
Thank you.
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
Stay on him!
Do not lose him.
Get around behind him.
Target moving past Mobile Unit 090.
Oh, no.
You gotta be kidding me.
Where is he? Target acquired.
Let's go.
My computer.
Give me that.
No. Not so tough now, huh?
Try those fancy moves again. Come on.
Stop.
Please.
Me angry... ...very bad.
You very angry?
I very angry. Oh, no.
You don't understand.
Something really bad is about to happen here. Yeah. Very bad.
Anybody else seeing this?
We got a bogey. Please advise.
That is the target!
Use every trank you've got. Do it now.
Go wide. Go wide.
Go wide. Move.
No.
Behind him. Get behind him. Move!
Move! Get him!
Get him! Get him!
Leave me alone.
No! No!
I knew something was different before I got the shot off.
Had it on him when he bolted.
Is that a girlfriend?
She helps him maybe? She is no longer a factor.
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone. He wants to be alone.
Let's see if he's been talking to anybody. Forgive me, sir.
Doesn't anybody want to talk about what went down in there, because...?
He didn't lose us.
And he was not alone, sir.
We had him, and then something hit us. Something...
Something big hit us.
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball.
It was the most powerful thing I've ever seen.
Well, it's gone.
Well, if Banner knows what it is... ...l'm gonna track him down, put my foot on his throat and...
That was Banner.
It... ...was Banner.
You have to explain that statement, sir.
No, I don't. You've done a good job.
Pack up and get our men on the plane.
We're going home. Can you help me?
I don't speak Portuguese.
What? Where...?
Where am I?
Guatemala.
I'm going to the next town.
Will you help me?
Get in.
Here, put this on.
Where are you going?
Home.
I've run into bad situations on crap missions before.
I've seen good men go down... ...because someone didn't let us know what we were walking into.
I've moved on because that's what we do.
I mean, that's the job.
But this...
This is a whole new level of weird.
I don't feel inclined to step away from it.
So if you're taking another crack at him, I want in.
And with respect, you should be looking for a team... ...that's prepped and ready to fight because if that thing shows up again... ...you'll have a lot of professional tough guys pissing in their pants... ...sir.
Oh, yeah.
Let me emphasise what I'm about to share with you... ...is tremendously sensitive both to me personally and the Army.
You're aware that we've got an infantry weapons development programme... ...while in WWil, they initiated a subprogramme... ...for biotech force enhancement.
A super soldier.
Yes.
An oversimplification, but yes.
And I dusted it off.
Got them doing serious work again. Bold work. Across the hall, they're trying to arm you better.
We're trying to make you better.
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application. He thought he was working on radiation resistance.
I would never have told him what the project really was.
But he was so sure of what he was onto... ...that he tested it on himself.
And something went very wrong. Or it went very right.
As far as I'm concerned, that man's whole body is property of the U.S. Army.
You said he wasn't working on weapons, right?
- No. - But you were, weren't you?
You were trying other things.
One serum we developed... ...it was very promising.
He's a scientist. He is not one of us.
Blonsky, how old are you? Forty-five?
- Thirty-nine.
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
Yes, it does. So get out of the trenches.
You should be a colonel now with your record.
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.
If I could take what I know now, put it in the body I had 10 years ago... ...that would be someone I wouldn't wanna fight.
I could probably arrange something like that.
Take care, kids.
Stan, I give you my word.
Whatever you've heard about me, it's not true.
I know it. I always knew it.
And you know how I felt about you two.
- Have you talked to her?
- No. She doesn't know that I'm here.
She's with somebody?
He's a head shrink. They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy. Good, that's good.  Bruce.
- What can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights. You can have the spare room upstairs.
That'd be so great. There is... There's one other thing.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through.
Hey, pal, I got a delivery on 5.
I don't think there's anybody up here.
Oh, man, I'm gonna catch hell if I don't collect.
You gotta let me try. I tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house. - You are the man. - God bless you, partner.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
We're pretty well closed here, folks, I'm sorry.
Oh, come on, Stan, it's Friday night.
Oh, kids.
- I got nothing but marinara now.
- I gotta have a Mr. Pink, please.
She worked through dinner again, of course.
Stan?
I go...
So, yes, I mean, where were you? I can't... I don't know where you were, Cecil.
Then he goes, "Not where you've been at."
I felt...
Oh, my God, I just felt so awful. Bruce.
Betty?
What's going on? Betty.
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.
I don't know what to say.
Please, just tell me the truth. Oh, God.
Thank God. I want you to come with me now.
Please, come with me.
Please.
It's our data.
That got in there before they carted it all away.
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us something someday.
- Does the general know you have this?
- No, I don't think so. I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.
- You have to be sure. - Bruce.
I don't understand why we can't just go in there together and talk to him.
He told me what he wanted to do. He wants it out of me.  He wants to dissect it so that he can replicate it.
He wants to make it a weapon.
- Hi. - Hi.
- I thought you might wanna...
- Thanks. Listen, I should leave early.
As early as I can. Really?
You can't stay at all? I want to, but it's not just safe for me to be here.
If I could borrow some cash...
- Of course. - I need to take a bus.
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.
Okay.
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah. - Good night.
- Good night.
I hope you get some rest.
We're giving you a very low dose only.
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.
First sign of any side effect... ...we stop and you're off team until you straighten out.
- Agreed? - Agreed.
You'll get two separate infusions.
One into the deep muscle... ...one into the bone-marrow centres.
Bone ones are gonna hurt.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four...  Is everything okay?
I think so.
- Come here.
- What? I just wanna do this.
- It's better like that. - Yeah.
- It's too tight, huh? - Yeah, a little.
Okay.
What?
They're here. Betty, look at me, look at me.
You have to go far away from me.
Don't argue with me, just go, go.
We'd have had snipers on target in three more minutes.
I wanna know who jumped the gun.
He's heading 270.
Move it. Blonsky, not yet.
Sir.
Look alive, this could get interesting.
Stop. I got him.  Stop.
Stop. I know you're in there.
General, please.
- Sir.
- Dad!
Dad, please don't do this.
You can't see this clearly. - Now, get inside. - There he is.
Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.
Do not engage. Repeat, do not engage.
He's lock ed in.
- Put two canisters in there with him.
- Fire.
Get her back here.
Now she'll see.
Alpha Team.
Let him have all of it.
Light him up. Come on, light him up.
Where are the.50 cals?
Move your asses. Fall back.  Oh, my God.
- Blonsky, now you're up. - Yes, sir.
Cover me.
Remember me?
My God, he's doing it.
Move him toward the cannons.
Move.
- All good. - Do it, now.
- Please, please, please, no, please.
- Get her back.
You're killing him! Stop!
Get off of me!
Where's the gunship?
- Is that it? - Blonsky, pull back now.
Pull back.
Is that all you got?
- Fall back. - Fall back. - Let's go, let's go.
- Find cover. - Move back, get down.
- Move it. Betty!
- Move it, move it, move it. - Take cover. Fire, goddamn it.
Bruce.
Stop firing!
No!
You did the right thing, calling me.
I need to know where they're going.
She's in danger as long as she's with him.
From who? He protected her.
You almost killed her.
I give you my word, her safety is my main concern at this point.
You know, it's a point of professional pride with me... ...that I can always tell when somebody's lying.
And you are.
I don't know where he's going.
- I know she'll help him if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive. And I can't help either one of them.
I used to wonder why she never talked about you.
Now I know.
Where does she meet these guys?
Bruce?
Bruce?
It's okay, it's okay.
Come here.
Come this way. Watch your head.
We're okay.
It's okay.
It's just the rain.
Will he ever walk again?
Most of the bones in his body look like crushed gravel right now.
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine. Never seen anything like it outside of a racehorse.
Here.
Bruce?
Oh, hi.
- Are you okay? - Yeah.
Yeah, actually I feel a lot better.
- Good. - I just had to get my data back.
- You ate it?
- Well, you know... ...the circumstances called for a little improvisation.
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection but I got you a few options.
First things first.
Oh, you're kidding me.
- What?
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair. - I'll take my chances.
Rumours continue to swirl about a violent clash... ... between forces of the U.S. Military and an unknown adversary... ... on the campus of Culver University earlier today.
Sophomores Jack McGee and Jim Wilson witnessed some of the battle.
It was so big.
- It was lik e this huge, lik e, hulk.
- Yeah.
McGee, who happens to be a reporter for the campus paper... ... captured this on his cell phone.
Further search for the mysterious hulk was postponed... ... by powerful thunderstorms in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.
Take short back there, okay?
I have done this before, you know.
I don't know how you've done this on your own for all this time.
With clippers, usually.
Wait, wait, wait.
- What? - We can't do this.
- It's okay, I want to.
- No. No.
I can't.
I can't get too excited.
Not even a little excited?
It's okay.
Sir, it's Blonsky.
Has anyone found out if he has next of kin or family?
You can ask him yourself.
Sir?
Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
Thank you, sir. How do you feel?
Pissed off and ready for round three.
Basically, we can't use any of this, because they can track all of it.
Well, my lip gloss, can they track that?
- No, you can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you. Well, I need my glasses.
Well, you can take your glasses and your watch, okay?
We can use most of it, we just can't use the credit cards, ID or phone.
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay. And we'll take the cash, obviously.
How are we gonna get where we need to go... ...on $40 and no credit cards?
- Well, we could sell this.
- No.
No, that's the only thing you have left from her. No. Well, we'll have to try and get it back.
Federals are already monitoring... ...phones, plastic, and Dr. Ross' web account.
Have been placed on alert. They'll pop up somewhere, and when they do it comes straight to us.
They're not gonna just pop up.
He made it 5 years and got across borders without making any mistakes.
He's not gonna use a credit card.
If he was trying to escape, he'd be long gone.
He's not trying to escape, he's looking for help.
That's how we're gonna get him.
We know what they're after.
He's been talking to somebody. You'll have copies of the correspondence.
Aliases Mr. Green and Mr. Blue... ... have been added to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Operations database.
If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.
If he mak es a peep we'll hear him.
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.
Smile.
What is it like?
When it happens, what do you experience?
Do you remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard?
Those induced hallucinations?
It's a lot like that.
It's a thousand times amplified. It's like someone's poured a litre of acid into my brain.
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments, images. There's too much noise, I can never derive anything out of it.
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No, it's not. I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me. Maybe your mind is in there.
It's just overcharged and can't process what's happening.
I don't wanna control it.
I wanna get rid of it. - You ready?
- Let's even the playing field a little.
Gentlemen?
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.
We gotta go, walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast. All right, come.
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway is probably quickest.
Me in a metal tube, deep underground... ...with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city?
Right, let's get a cab.
Come on, now. Let's go.
You're too slow, you drive like a woman. - Very nice, you see her? - Oh, my God.
She's very pretty.
Look out, you goat. Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Are you out of your mind?
What is wrong with you? What's the matter, baby?
You don't like a good ride?
Asshole!
I know a few techniques could help you manage that anger very effectively.
You, zip it. - We're walking. - Okay.
Excuse me, Dr. Sterns. - Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.
Dr. Ross.
I have someone who'd like to meet you.
Okay. It's Mr. Blue, isn't it?
Mr. Green?
I've gotta tell you, I've been wondering if you were even real.
And if you were, what would it look like?
A person with that much power lurking in him.
Nothing could have surprised me more... ...than this unassuming man shaking my hand.
But look, we're not strolling in the park for a picnic here.
Even if everything goes perfectly, if we induce an episode... ...if we get the dosage exactly right, is that gonna be a lasting cure?
Or just some antidote to suppress that specific flare-up?
I don't know.
What I'm saying is... ...that if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer... ...we're dealing with concentrations with extraordinary levels of toxicity...
- You mean it could kill him? - Kill him, yeah. I should say so.
You should know there's a flipside to this too.
If we miss on the low side, if we induce me... ...and it fails, this will be very dangerous for you.
Look, I've always been more curious than cautious.
And that's served me pretty well.
So are we gonna do this? How are you feeling, man?
Like a monster.
Okay, on the table.
These will protect you from yourself... ...if you have a strong reaction.
You can tell me later if you thought it was strong. Oh, come on.
Stupid graduate students. Okay. You.
You. You.
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.
We have begun.
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood.
So the antidote will only take hold once we've achieved the full reaction.
Okay, we are comprehensive.
Here we go.
All right, we set to pop?
I'd take your hands off him.
Oh, my God.
Wait, wait, there's more.
Wait. - No. Hang on.
- Wait. Now do it.
Do it! Bruce, Bruce, look at me.
Stay with me. The antidote.
Now. Sterns, do it now.  Bruce, look at me.
Look in my eyes. Please look in my eyes.  You've gotta be kidding.
- Bruce.
- Oh, my God.
Bruce?
Bruce, can you hear me? Bruce.
It's okay, you're okay.
You're okay. You did it.
- He's fine, this is fantastic.
- It's over.
- Hi.
- Hi.
That was the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my entire life.
We need to talk about what happened in there.
Absolutely, okay.
The gamma pulse came from the amygdala.
I think Dr. Ross' primer lets the cells absorb the energy temporarily... ...and then it abates.
That's why you didn't die of radiation sickness years ago.
Now, maybe we've neutralised those cells permanently... ...or maybe we just suppressed that event.
I'm inclined to think the latter, it's hard to know.
Because none of our test subjects ever survived.
Wait. What did you just say?
- They weren't getting the primer.
- No, no, test subjects?
What test subjects?
Come with me.
- What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha Sector. We started on rats and mice, but it just completely fried them... ... we had to go bigger.
We still don't know which is more toxic.
- The gamma or your blood. - What do you mean, my blood?
Bruce, this is all you. You didn't send me much to work with... ...so I had to concentrate it and make more.
With a little more trial and error, there's no end to what we can do.
This is potentially Olympian.
This gamma technology has limitless applications.
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.
We will make humans impervious to disease.
No, no, we've gotta destroy it.
- Wait, what? - All of it, tonight.
We're gonna incinerate it.
Is this the whole supply?
We could get the Nobel for this.
You don't understand the power of this thing.
It is too dangerous, it cannot be controlled.
At your discretion, shooter.
Yeah, but this is Promethean fire.
No shot.
Blonsky is going in.
Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there. - We have the antidote now.
- They don't want the antidote.
They wanna make it a weapon. If we let it go, we will never get it back.
You have no idea how powerful this thing is.
I hate the government as much as anyone.
But you're being a little paranoid, don't you think?
Bruce, Bruce.
Get out.
Where is it?
Come on, where is it? Show him to me.
Blonsky.
Miss, take this.
If you took it from me, I'm gonna put you in a hole for the rest of your life.
Betty.
I will never forgive what you have done to him.
- He's a fugitive.
- You made him a fugitive.
To cover your failures and to protect your career.
Don't ever speak to me as your daughter again.
It's only because you're my daughter that you're not in handcuffs too.
Are you telling me you can make more like him?
No, not yet, I've sorted out a few pieces... ...but it's not like I can put together the same Humpty Dumpty.
If that's what you're asking. He was a freak accident. If that's what you're asking.
The goal is to do it better. So Banner is the only...
Now, she's an annoying bitch.
Why are you always hitting people? Now, what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression?
It's not what you've done, it's what you're gonna do.
I want what you got out of Banner, I want that.
You look like you've got a little something in you already, don't you?
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right? I have.
And it's beautiful.
Godlike.
I want that.
Need that. Give me that.
I don't know what you've got inside you already.
The mixture could be an abomination.
I didn't say I was unwilling.
I just need informed consent.
And you've given it.
This is what I was trying to explain.
I don't know what you've been ladling into yourself.
But clearly it worked.
Let's assume you don't understand a word I'm saying... ...but if you'll just get back on the table... ...I can fix this.
Shoot it!
No!
Delta 4 to leader.
They still got two of our guys.
Two of our guys... ...Blonsky and the major, are still inside.
Come on, move, move, move.
It's over there!
- What is that thing?
- Shoot it! Okay, all right. You, you drive.
Let's go. Move, move. Delta 4 to leader.
Something big just went off down here.
General, you should hear this.
The hulk is in the street.
I repeat, the hulk is in the street. That's impossible. You get ahold of yourself.
You get it together. What is your position?
121 st Street, heading north on Broadway.
Turn us around.
We're going back. Why are we going back?
Damn it, give me eyes down there.
Yes, sir.
What the hell was that?
Go, go, go.
No.
One of yours?
Oh, my God.
What have you done? Fire! Fire!
You think a rifle's gonna hurt that?
Come on.
Sweet.
Get out of there, soldier.
Stand back!
Give me a real fight.
No, no, no! Sir?
Sir?
Tell them to bring everything they've got and head for Harlem.
It has to be me.
- You have to take me back there. - What are you saying?
You think you can control...
No, no, not control it, but, I don't know, maybe aim it.
And what if you can't?
We made this thing.
All of us.
Please.
- Land us near it. - No, no.
No, keep us high. Open the back door.
Bruce. Bruce, stop.
Stop. What are you doing? Think about this.
You don't even know if you'll change. You don't have to do this, please.
This is insane. Betty, I've gotta try.
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit.
Get her in here.
Come on, miss. There. Betty.
Hulk.
Come on.
Is that all you've got?
Use that thing, soldier.
Give him some help. Which one?
Help the green one, damn it.
Which one do you think? Cut the other one in half.
Ross.
Keep it on him.
I gotta put it down.
Hang on. Dad.
Are you hurt?
Let me help you. I'm all right. Just find a way out.
You don't deserve this power.
Now watch her die. Look out!
General.
Any last words?
Hulk... ...smash!
Stop!
It's okay.
Betty.
Reload.
Reload.
The smell of stale beer and defeat.
You know, I hate to say I told you so.
But that super soldier programme was put on ice for a reason.
I've always felt that hardware was much more reliable.
Stark.
General. You always wear such nice suits.
Touch?.
I hear you have an unusual problem.
You should talk. You should listen.
What if I told you we're putting a team together?
Who's we?
This was a roNy re-encode for 300MBUNiTED.com
Looks like they screwed up the english subtitle translations on the retail DVDs and BluRays.

Do you remember that fire in Ängby?
A house burned down and a body was found inside.
We knew that the fire had been set to conceal the fact that the person had been murdered beforehand.
So, how could they know that? Well... - Go ahead.
There was no smoke in the lungs of the person who died.
That's correct.
Did you figure that out right now? No, I read a lot...
What kind of books would that be?
Just books.
Okay... I'm going to talk to you about drugs.
What do you think are the most common types of drugs...
Hey, Oskar... What are you staring at?
Are you looking at me? Well, fuck off!
What a good piggy you are.
- Come on, it's time for PE.
Here's the weather forecast...
- I don't have a watch. - What's that?
- This? It's called halotane.
Well? Are you looking at me?
Well, fuck off!
What's your problem?
Are you scared? So, scream.
Squeal!
- Nothing. - Do you live here?
- Yeah...
I live right here, in the jungle gym. Seriously, where do you live?
- Next door to you.
- How do you know where I live?
Just so you know, I can't be your friend.
- What do you mean? - Does there have to be a reason?
That's just the way it is.
Are you so sure that I want to be your friend?
Forgive me.
They don't know why the boy was killed.
I realize that many of you may be worried.
The counselor will be here all day, so go talk to her if you feel the need.
Any questions?
Is it all right to kill the killer if you happen to meet him?
That wasn't very nice, Conny.
Where are you, Piggy?
- Where are you, Piggy? - Piggy!
And don't leave the courtyard until I get home. - It was way over in Väilingby.
- A person who kills children... ...is certainly capable of taking the subway two stations.
Or walking a mile.
KlLLER TAPS BLOOD
The death penalty has no justification in a society based on the rule of law.
Based on the rule of law?
The government wants us to believe that crap, just like the Russians...
Are you saying there aren't any Russians? - Of course there are...
- Never seen the guy before. But take rattlesnakes...
Does anyone actually get bitten?
That guy over there just moved into my neighborhood. He has a kid.
They're in Janne's old place.
- Should I ask him to join us? - Sure...
He might pay for a round. In that case, he's welcome even if he has cancer.
Yeah, life stinks...
You just moved into number 15, right?
You don't have to sit here all alone, join us and have a laugh.
No thanks, I'm in a hurry.
Aren't you going to watch the show? No, it's no good.
Stay in the courtyard, okay?
I'll just watch this on my own, then.
So you're back. - I want to be left alone.
- So do l.
Then go home. You go home, I've lived here way longer than you.
- What's that?
It's a Rubik's cube. Is it some kind of puzzle?
Yeah...
- I might not be here tomorrow.
The day after, then. But that's it.
You want each side to be a solid color. Like this...
- Why not? - I guess I've forgotten how.
See you tomorrow.
Good night, old buddy.
- See you tomorrow. - You're the best, Jocke!
Help...
Please help me.
Is something wrong?
- Can you get up?
Oh...
I'll carry you, and take you to a phone. - Careful. - You don't weigh a thing.
Bloody hell!
I haven't seen you all year. Jocke...  Jocke!
I was out on the balcony and I saw...
I saw Jocke and this kid...
How big was this kid?
It was around here somewhere.
Move it.
What the hell is this?
Christ! It's blood!  Who the hell did this?
Eli.
- What's yours?
- Eli? I'm Oskar.  - How old are you?
- 12... more or less.
What about you? 12 years, 8 months and 9 days.
What do you mean, "more or less"?
When's your birthday? I don't know.
Don't you celebrate your birthday?
Your parents... they've got to know.
No.
It's yours.
Want me to show you?
- Start with the corners. Then this part. And you put...
Like this... No, like this.
Then this...
"...slipping in and out of the shadows, running quick and quiet and keeping out of the sun; so soon they went back, grumbling and cursing, to guard the door.
Bilbo had escaped."
Has everyone handed in their slips for the field trip on Thursday?
Well then, class dismissed.
- No, I have stuff to do.
Hurry up, Conny.
What do you mean?
Show it to me.
Hand it over.
Wait for me!
Oskar...
- I tripped on this rock.
- Oh, honey... You've got to watch your step.
Short, long, long, short, long... - Short, long, long, short, long.
- Exactly. Here...
There...
Some classmates...
- Where do you go to school? - Oskar, listen...
Hit back.
You've never hit back...
Have you?
So do it. Hit back.
Hard.
Hit harder than you dare, then they'll stop.
- What if...? - Then I'll help you.
I can do that.
Come on.
You're in the way.
Go on.
Let's see, short, short...
Not too close, not too far.
Keep distance. Nice and steady.
The after school weight-lifting program... Could I sign up for it?
You don't have to sign up, just be there at seven.
Are you thinking of doing it? Good.
If you practice, you can make strong.
See you.
Mixed candy.
Too bad.
I can... try one.
Do you like me?
Yeah, a lot.
If I wasn't a girl... ...would you like me anyway?
I suppose so.
Why do you ask?
Hello, son.
- You're early. - Hi, Dad.
There are people who know my face, who know that I live here with you.
Maybe you shouldn't.
What else am I good for?
Could you do one thing for me?
Could you not see that boy tonight?
Please?
What's taking Matte so long?
You can jerk off at home.
Matte, hurry up.
What are you up to?
- Matte! - Let me down.
Let me down...
Help!
- Open the god damn door!
- Help! Help!!
- What are you doing up there?
...according to Communist Party Chairman Brezhnev.
An unidentified man was arrested yesterday, charged with murder and attempted murder in Väilingby, near Stockholm.
The man's self-inflicted facial wounds make it hard to determine his identity.
And now, sports... Come on in.
Through those doors.
Excuse me, I'm looking for my dad.
Has he been admitted to this hospital?
What's his name?
He's sick, the police brought him in.
Do you know where he is?
He's up on the seventh floor.
Only that's a restricted ward.
I could call them... That's all right.
Oh, you poor thing...
May I come in?
What kid?
- Why would a kid kill Jocke?
- I don't know. Jocke's the sweetest guy there ever was.
I'd like to tear that damn kid limb from limb.
Oskar!
May I come in?
Don't look at me.
But you have to say that I can come in.
You can come in...
Close your eyes.
- I flew. - Yeah, sure...
You're not wearing anything.
You're as cold as ice.
Sorry...
Is that gross?
No...
Higgledy-piggledy shout.
How many fingers are out? Eli...
Want to go steady?
What do you mean?
Well...
Do you want to be my girlfriend?
Oskar...
I'm not a girl.
Oh...
But do you want to go steady or not?
Couldn't we just keep things the way they are?
I guess...
Do you do anything special when you go steady?
No.
So everything's the same?
Yes.
Then we'll go steady.
It'll be you and me.
Really?
Good.
Lower school, skate with me.
Middle school, free skating.
Watch out for holy, over there.
- Understood? - Avila...
- It's a "hole in the ice".
- Oh... I meant hole in the ice.
- Fancy a swim?
- Beware of holy in ice.
So, do you want to go swimming?
Mr. Avila, I have to pee.
- On the ice? What does it matter?
You make new ice, yellow ice. What's that stick for?
To hit you with, if you try anything.
Are you a brave pig, all of a sudden?
I'm going to push you, and you aren't going to do a thing. Isn't that so?
Little piggy watch your step, or I'll get you...
Mr. Avila will freak out...
Are we supposed to just let him stand there?
What's going on?! What are you up to?
Oh yes, they will blame us!
Am I supposed to tell them my son doesn't have a father? Yes, it is!  Here he comes.
They called from school.
And you'd better talk to your father, because I...
Hello.
I'm fine.
I don't know.
Is the bike working?
We'll see.
So you did go swimming after all?
I'm only kidding.
We're not really allowed to be in here. But some of the bigger kids hang out here anyway.
And you know what?
Today. .. They tried to push me into a hole in the ice, but I ...
I had this stick, and I hit Conny so hard that he had to go to the ER.
Oskar... Yeah?
Bravo!
What did you want us to do?
We're going to mix. .. It doesn't hurt.
All you need to do is poke your finger.
Go away!
They had to use a chainsaw to get him out. Go tell the cops your story. - What's your problem, Gösta?
- They'll ask me questions. .. What do you mean?
They might shut me into one of those rooms. .. ...and shine bright lights in my eyes.. .
- Jocke and I were this close.
- I'm sorry, but I can't...
It's your duty, you witnessed a crime. Christ...
You go on about what a great guy he was...
But now that he's gone, I have nothing left.
Nothing...
- Oh, Lacke...
- Stop it!
Don't you "oh, Lacke" me!
You don't get it, you're so damn cold. No one gets it...
Smooth, Lacke. Ginia, please...
Wait up!
Could we at least talk about it?
Come on...
Get off her!
You took my lighter.
I didn't mean it, Ginia... I love you.
What the hell.. .?
- I didn't see that coming. - You never do. - But this time I'll get you.
- Dream on. You go first.
- Well look who's here! - Good evening to you all.
You look like you're having a grand old time. That's right.
And Oskar's here...
Right... Dad...
- It's your turn.
- We have guests. It's nice and cozy in here.
So you had a little something, then?
It ended up all wrong.
It was supposed to be great, but their calculations were all wrong. It was all wrong from the start.
And it just got worse.
So when you pass these buildings...
Pretty damn busy around here tonight. Come on in.
Where the hell have you been?
What's going on? I've been so damn worried. - What's wrong?
- Leave me alone!
No...
Open the door, you bastard!
Let go! No...
Oskar, is that you? Yeah.
Are you a vampire? I live off blood...
Yes.
Are you... ...dead?
No.
Can't you tell?
But...
Are you old?
I'm twelve.
But I've been twelve for a long time.
Are you like, poor? See that egg over there?
If you sold it, you could buy a whole nuclear power plant.
For real.
Yeah, sure...
Put your finger on it.
Where do those rings come from?
I'm going home.
I have flyers to distribute tomorrow.
To make money? I can give you money.
Take it if you like.
You stole this... ...from the people you killed, right?
- It was given to me. - By who?
By different people.
I want to go home now. If you'll let me.
It's time to sell it... Dad's stamp collection.
What a guy, one stamp...
80,000. Eighty grand.
If you find the right buyer. I won't accept any less...
Then we'll buy that nice cottage.
The countryside is so beautiful.
The two of us can live there.
Listen to the birds sing and grow our own vegetables.. . Lacke, you've got to help me.
Sure...
That kid...
She must have infected me somehow.
I don't want to live.
Good morning! Things are looking up.
You can probably go home today.
Won't that be nice?
I'll just unlock this.
And take a blood sample. There...
Listen...
Could you open the blinds? Sure...
No problem.
Hand over your cap. Do it! What's your problem?
Give it to me.
What are you, some kind of moron? Give it to me.
Go for it, Conny!
- Put up a fight.. . - Are you blind as well as deaf?
- Hey...
- What's up?
Could I borrow your keys?
I want to go home. - Sure.
Here you go. - Thanks. See you later.
- Who's the boss at your house? - Well, well... - What are you laughing at?
- Are you hard of hearing, Conny?
- Hey. - Hi.
You have to invite me in.
What happens if I don't? What happens if you walk in anyway?
Is there something in the way?
No!
You can come in!
Who are you?
I'm like you.
What do you mean?
What are you staring at? Well?
Are you looking at me? So scream!
Squeal!
Those were the first words I heard you say.
I don't kill people.
But you'd like to, if you could...
To get revenge. Right? Yes.
I do it because I have to.
Be me, for a little while.
Please... be me, for a little while.
You can borrow one of my mom's dresses.
Oskar...
Let me in. What are you up to?
I'm in the bathroom, I'm coming.
Let me in, Oskar...
Hi, I'm in the bathroom. Please don't go in. Want to hang out tonight?
I really like you. Yours, Eli.
I can't see a thing... No!
Let go of me!
Thank you.
Oskar... I've got to go away.
WHO KlLLED THE MAN IN THE ICE?
Hello? Is that you, Oskar?
It's me, Martin. Mr. Avila wanted to know if you're coming tonight.
Why?
I guess he just wanted to know.
Maybe he wants you to be there.
I'm not sure. . .
It was good, by the way. . . What you did to Conny.
- He had it coming. - What an actor. . .
Do you think so?
So, are you coming tonight?
- Good , Oskar. - Hi. . .
Hello, Oskar.
Hello.
Come, we'll start with aqua aerobics.
Hurry up!
Come on, Oskar! Move your body. . .
What? Christ. . . !
Call the fire department!
Beat it!
Do you know who I am?
- Yes. . .
- Good . Then you get it.
We're going to have a little contest.
You stay under water. . . . . .for three minutes.
If you can do it, I'll just nick you .
But if you can't,
I'll poke one of your eyes out.
An eye for an ear, right?
But that's impossible.
That's your problem.
Three minutes.
Better take a deep breath.
Five, four, three. . . . . .two, one.
- Jimmy. . .
- Shut up!
- Let's go, Conny. - I told you to shut up!
You've reached Doug. Sorry I missed your call.
Please leave a name and number and I'll get back to you.
STU : Hi, you've reached... ...Dr. Stuart Price with Divine Dentistry.
Please leave a message after...
PHlL : Hey, this is Phil.
Leave me a message or don 't.
- Anything? TRACY: I tried them all.
It keeps going straight to voicemail. Well, there has to be an explanation.  Sweetie, it's Vegas.
You lose track of time in casinos. There's no windows, there's no clocks.
He's probably on a heater.
And you never walk away from the table when you're on a heater.
You do if you're getting married.
- Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil.
Phil, where the hell are you guys? I'm freaking out.
Yeah, listen.
We fucked up.
What are you talking about?
The bachelor party, the whole night.
Things got out of control, uh... ...and we lost Doug.
- What? - We can't find Doug.
What are you saying, Phil? We're getting married in five hours.
Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.
MAN: To my left a little.
- Whoa, watch it, pervert!
- Alan, he's just doing your inseam.
- He's getting very close to my shaft.
- All done. You can change now. Right.
Thanks, Floyd. Thank you very much.
All right, buddy, we should get a move on.
You know, Doug, I was thinking...
If you wanna go to Vegas without me, that is totally cool, you know?
What are you talking about?
You know, Phil and Stu, they're your buddies, and it's your bachelor party.
Come on, Alan. Those two love you.
ALAN: And also, I don't want you to feel like you have to hold back... ...because your wife's brother's there.
I just... It's not like that.
It's not like that. I already told you, Alan.
We're just spending the night in Vegas.
It's no big deal. Besides, you're not just my wife's brother, you're my brother now.
I want you to know, Doug, I'm a steel trap.
Whatever happens tonight, I will never, ever, ever, speak a word of it.
Okay. Yeah, I got it. Thank you.
I don't think that... Seriously. I don't care what happens.
- I don't care if we kill someone. - What?
You heard me. It's Sin City.
I won't tell a soul.
Okay. I got it.
- Thank you. No, thank you.
I love you so much.
DOUG: No. Sid.
- Really? SlD: Come on, we're family now.
- You sure? I mean, you love this car.
- Doug, it's just a car.
Just make sure to put some Armour All on the tires so the sand doesn't sleep in.
Absolutely. That's easy.
Oh, and, uh, don't let Alan drive... ...because there's something wrong with him.
DOUG: Understood. - Oh, and Phil either.
I will be the only one driving this car. I promise. Good.
Remember, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
Ah! Except for herpes. That shit'll come back with you.
All right. Hold on.
I still need some of your permission slips... ...and $90 for the field trip to the Griffith Observatory next weekend.
Pay now, or forever regret missing out on the experience of a lifetime, guys.
You're good, you got it. STUDENT:
Thanks, Mr. Wenneck. PHlL: Thank you, Russ.
Ahem, do you have to park so close? - Yeah.
What's wrong? - I shouldn't be here.
Why is that, Alan? I'm not supposed to be within 200 feet of a school.
- What? - Or a Chuck E. Cheese.
Mr. Wenneck, I was... - It's the weekend. I don't know you.
- Shit. DOUG: Heh, heh, heh.
I'm driving. DOUG: Whoa, no chance, buddy...
Watch the leath... Shut up and drive before these nerds ask me another question.
- Animal. - Who's this? - It's Alan.
- I met you, like, four times. Oh, yeah. How you doing, man?
MELlSSA: Don't forget your Rogaine. STU:
And don't forget to use it.
I can totally tell when you forget, your hair just looks thinner.
Using of the Rogaine, check.
Make sure to call me right when you get to the hotel... ...not like that conference in Phoenix.
I had to wait two hours for you to call me.
Yeah, I was the keynote speaker. I was late to the podium.
- Still? - Yeah, you're totally right. I'm sorry.
- What is the matter? MELlSSA: I don't know.
I hope you're not gonna go to some strip club when you're up there.
STU: Melissa, we're going to Napa Valley.
I don't even think they have strip clubs in wine country.
Well, I'm sure if there is one, Phil will sniff it out.
Besides, you know how I feel about that.
I know, I know. It's just boys and their bachelor parties, it's gross.
You're right, it is gross.
- Not to mention it's pathetic. - Mm-hm. - Those places are filthy.
And the worst part is... ...that little girl... ...grinding and dry humping the fucking stage up there... ...that's somebody's daughter up there.
- I was just gonna say that. See?
I just wish your friends were as mature as you.
They are mature, actually. You just have to get to know them better.
PHlL: Paging Dr. Faggot.
Dr. Faggot!
- I should go. - That's a good idea, Dr. Faggot.
Have a good weekend. I'm gonna miss you.
Road trip!
Vegas! Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
Come on, just till Barstow. Everybody's passing us.
Absolutely not. I promised Sid. I will be the only one driving this car.
Besides, you're drinking. Oh, what are you, a cop now?
You know I drive great when I'm drunk.
True. Don't forget, Phil was always our designated drunk driver. Yeah.
You wanna explain it to them, Alan?
Guys, my dad loves this car more than he loves me, so, yeah.
Aw, whatever. I left my wife and kid at home so I could go with you guys.
- You know how difficult that was?
- That's really sweet.
- Dude, I was being sarcastic. I fucking hate my life.
I may never go back. I might stay in Vegas.
Here we go.
Doug, enjoy yourself, because come Sunday... ...you're gonna start dying just a little bit every day.
That's why I've managed to stay single this whole time, you know?
- Oh, really? That's why you're single? - Yeah.
- Am I all right over there, Alan?
- Yeah, you're good.
DOUG: Aw, Jesus Christ! - Oh, my God!
- That was awesome!
That was not awesome. What's wrong with you?
- That was insane. We almost just died.
- You should have seen your face. - Classic.
It's not funny.
- Boy, you've got a sweet ride there. - Don't touch it.
Don't even look at it. Go on, get out. You heard me.
Don't look at me, either.
Yeah, you better walk on.
- He's actually kind of funny. - Yeah, he means well.
ALAN: I'll hit an old man in public.
Is he all there?
Like, mentally? I think so. He's just an odd guy.
- I mean, should we be worried? - No. - All right.
Tracy did mention that we shouldn't let him gamble. Or drink too much.
Jesus, he's like a gremlin. Comes with instructions and shit.
STU: And one water.
- All good with Melissa? - Oh, yeah.
Told her we're two hours outside of wine country, and she bought it.
You think it's strange you've been in a relationship for years... ...and you have to lie about Vegas?
But trust me, it's not worth the fight.
Oh, so you can't go to Vegas... ...but she can fuck a bellhop on a Carnival Cruise Line? Hey.
Okay, first of all, he was a bartender. And she was wasted.
And, if you must know, he didn't even come inside her.
And you believe that?
Uh, yeah, I do believe that, because she's grossed out by semen.
That'll be 32.50.
It's 32.50, you gonna pay for it?
It says here we should work in teams. Who wants to be my spotter?
I don't think you should be doing too much gambling tonight, Alan.
Gambling? Who said anything about gambling?
It's not gambling when you know you're gonna win.
Counting cards is a foolproof system.
It's also illegal.
It's not illegal, it's frowned upon, like masturbating on an airplane.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal too.
Yeah, maybe after 9/11, where everybody got so sensitive.
Thanks a lot, Bin Laden.
Either way, you gotta be super smart to count cards, buddy, okay? ALAN: Oh, really?
- It's not easy.
Well maybe we should tell that to Rain Man... ...because he practically bankrupted a casino, and he was a retard.
What?
He was a retard.
Retard.
PHlL: Here we go.
WOMAN: Hi, welcome to Caesars. STU:
Hello. WOMAN: Checking in?
We have a reservation under Dr. Price. LlSA: Okay, let me look that up for you.
Dr. Price? Stu, you're a dentist, okay? Don't try and get fancy.
- It's not fancy if it's true. - He's a dentist. Don't get too excited.
And if, uh, someone has a heart attack, you should still call 911.
We'll be sure to do that.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you know if the hotel's pager-friendly? - What do you mean?
- I'm not getting a sign on my beeper. - I'm not sure. ALAN:
Is there a payphone bank? Bunch of payphones? Business.
Um, there's a phone in your room. That'll work.
So I have you in a two-bedroom suite on the 12th floor, is that okay?
It sounds perfect. Actually, I was wondering if you had any villas.
- We're not even gonna be in the room. - It's unnecessary.
No big deal. We can share beds. It's one night.
If we're share beds, I'm bunking with Phil.
- You good with that? - No, I'm not.
Guys, we are not sharing beds. What are we, 12 years old?
Lisa, I apologize. How much is the villa?
Well, we have one villa available, and it's 4200 for the night.
- Is it awesome? - It's pretty awesome.
- We'll take it.
Give her your credit card. - I can't give her my credit card.
- We'll split it. - Are you crazy? No, this is on us.
You don't get it. Melissa checks my statements.
We just need a credit card on file.
We won't charge you until check out, so you can figure it out then.
That's perfect. Thank you, Lisa.
We'll deal with it tomorrow. Come on.
Fine.
- Can I ask you another question? LlSA: Sure.
You probably get this a lot. This isn't the real Caesars Palace, is it?
What do you mean?
- Did Caesar live here? - Um, no.
I didn't think so.
STU: Holy shit. PHlL:
Now, this is Vegas. DOUG:
Oh, my... This place is enormous. PHlL:
Now we're talking.
Is this all one suite?
Thank you, guys. Or should I say, "Thank you, Stu"?
You're welcome. It's only because I love you.
PHlL: Okay, ladies, pick a room, get dressed. Let's be ready in 30 minutes.
I just wish you could see this place, because you, of all people, would love it.
Yeah. No, it's so quaint.
Yeah, no, there's no TVs, no phones.
They just have these cute little antique radios in all the rooms.
What else?
We met the, uh, proprietor. - Oh, I bet you... STU:
Um, Caesar. Palace. Yeah, like the salad.
Okay. Well, listen, I gotta go, because we're gonna hit this wine tasting.
Wait, wait.
I love you. Okay. Bye.
I'm not even gonna say anything, it's so embarrassing.
- Where's Alan? - He, uh, he went downstairs.
He said he had to grab a few things.
Good, because I have something to show you.
- What the hell is that? STU: What do you think?
If it's what I think it is, I think it's a big fucking mistake.
I'm gonna propose to Melissa at your wedding. After the ceremony.
- Stuey, congratulations! - Thank you, Doug.
- That's a beautiful ring. - Yeah. It's my grandmother's.
She made it all the way through the Holocaust with that thing.
Wait, have you not listened to anything I have ever said?
Phil, we've been dating for three years. It's time. This is how it works.
A, that is bullshit. And B, she is a complete bitch.
Hey, that's his fiancée.
What? It's true. It's true.
That was twice, and I was out of line. She's strong-willed. And I respect that.
Wow. Wow. He's in denial.
Not to mention, she fucked a sailor.
DOUG: Hey, he wasn't a sailor. He was a bartender on a cruise ship.
Guys, I'm standing right here. So I can hear everything that you're saying.
Hey, guys. You ready to let the dogs out? - What?
ALAN: Let the dogs out. You know.
Who brought this guy?
DOUG: Yes, Alan, we are ready to let the dogs out. - Hey, congrats.
- You're not really wearing that, are you? - Wearing what?
You're actually gonna wear that or are you guys fucking with me?
It's where I keep all my things. I get a lot of compliments on this.
Plus, it's not a man-purse. It's called a satchel. Indiana Jones wears one.
So does Joy Behar.
- We're going up, guys. - Yeah, that's perfect.
STU: Really?
We're going up?
I'm just saying, it's clearly marked, okay?
We are definitely not supposed to be up here.
Come on, we're paying for a villa. We can do whatever the fuck we want.
- Yeah, but...
- Just wedge the door open.
DOUG: How the hell did you find this place? Don't worry about it.
- You all right? - Yeah.
- Look at the view up here. - You happy? - This is great.
- Whoa! Are you kidding?
PHlL: Alan, how we doing, buddy?
- Good. DOUG: What do you got over there, Alan?
STU:
- Right? - A little Jägermeister. - Good idea.
Um, no, this is good. I'd like to make a toast.
To Doug and Tracy.
May tonight be... ...but a minor speed bump... ...in an otherwise very long and healthy marriage.
- Cheers.
DOUG: Oh, it's like college. - All right.
All right. - I want to... ALAN:
I'd like to say something... ...that I prepared... ...tonight. - All right, Alan.
"Hello.
How about that ride in?
I guess that's why they call it Sin City.
You guys might not know this, but I consider myself a bit of a loner.
I tend to think of myself as a one-man wolf pack.
But when my sister brought Doug home, I knew he was one of my own.
And my wolf pack, it grew by one.
So were there two... So there were two of us in the wolf pack.
I was alone first in the pack, and then Doug joined in later.
And six months ago... ...when Doug introduced me to you guys, I thought:
Could it be?' And now, I know for sure. I just added two more guys to my wolf pack."
- All right.
- All right. ALAN: "Four of us wolves... ...running around the desert together in Las Vegas... ...Looking for strippers and cocaine."
So tonight... ...I make a toast. - Whoa.
- What...?
PHlL: Dude, what the fuck? DOUG:
- What is that? - Blood brothers.
- Don't... Why did you...? - Damn it.
Alan, we're not gonna cut ourselves. Give me the knife. Slowly.
Thank you very much. PHlL: You all right?
- Do you need a doctor? - He's good.
PHlL: You sure? ALAN:
- Perfect. Alan, come here, buddy. STU:
All right, to a night the four of us will never forget.
There it is. PHlL: Hear, hear.
PHlL:
Control yourself, man. Goddamn, will you put on some pants?
- Phil, do not go in the bathroom. - Al, just calm down.
It's me. Phil, there is a tiger in the bathroom.
- What's going on?
- There's a jungle cat in the bathroom!
- Okay, okay, Al. Al, I'll check it out. ALAN:
Don't go in, don't go in. Be careful.
He's not kidding. ALAN: See?
- There's a tiger in there. - No, there isn't.
- It's big.
- You okay, buddy? No. I am in so much pain right now.
Goddamn. Look at this place.
I know. Phil, they have my credit card downstairs. I am so screwed.
How does a tiger get in the bathroom? It almost killed me.
Hey, bro? You mind putting on some pants? I find it a little weird I have to ask twice.
ALAN: Pants at a time like this?
What the fuck happened last night?
Hey, Phil, am I missing a tooth?
Oh, my God.
My lateral incisor's... It's gone!
It's okay. Okay, okay. Just calm down.
Alan, go wake up Doug.
Let's get some coffee and get the fuck out of Nevada... ...before housekeeping shows.
What am I gonna tell Melissa? I lost a tooth. I have no idea how it happened.
You're freaking me out, man. I got a massive headache, okay? Let's just calm down.
How am I supposed to calm down? Look around you.
- Hey, guys, he's not in there.
- Did you check all the rooms? Yeah, I looked everywhere.
Plus, his mattress is gone.
He probably went to the pool to get something to eat. I'll just call his cell.
I look like a nerdy hillbilly.
- Alan. Hey.
- It's Phil. - Oh, hey, Phi...
This is Doug's phone. This is Doug's phone.
PHlL: No shit. - Yeah.
What the fuck is that?
Whose fucking baby is that?
Alan, are you sure you didn't see anyone else in the suite?
Yeah, I checked all the rooms.
No one's here. Check its collar or something.
- It's okay, baby.
- Stu, we don't have time for this.
Let's go hook up with Doug, we'll deal with the baby later.
Phil, we're not gonna leave a baby in the room.
- There's a fucking tiger in the bathroom.
- It's not our baby. Yeah, I gotta side with Stu on this one.
All right, fine. Okay, we'll take it with us. Could you at least just find some pants?
Why can't we remember a goddamn thing from last night?
Because we obviously had a great fucking time.
Why don't you just stop worrying for one minute.
Be proud of yourself.
Oh, how cute. What's his name?
- Ben.
- Carlos.
Carlos?
Hey, Phil, look.
He's jacking his little weenies.
- Pull yourself together, man.
- Not at the table, Carlos.
I looked everywhere.
Gym, casino, front desk. Nobody's seen Doug.
He's not here. He's fine. He's a grown man.
Seriously, Stu, you gotta calm down. Here, have some juice.
I can't have juice right now. Okay. All right.
What's the last thing we remember doing last night?
Well, the first thing was we were on the roof... ...and were having those shots of Jäger.
And then we ate dinner at The Palm. Right?
That's right. And then we played craps at the Hard Rock, and I think Doug was there.
That sounds right. No, no. He definitely was.
You know what, guys? I don't even remember going to dinner.
What the fuck? I don't think I've ever been this hung-over.
After the Hard Rock, I blacked out. It was like emptiness.
We have up until 10 p. m... ...so that gives us a 12-hour window where we could have lost him.
What is this? - Oh, my God. That is my tooth.
Why do you have that?
What else is in your pockets?
This is a good thing. No. Check your pockets.
Check your pockets. Do you have anything?
I have an ATM receipt from the Bellagio.
Eleven-oh-five for $800! I am so fucked.
I have a valet ticket from Caesars. Looks like we got in at 5: 15 a.m.
Oh, shit. We drove last night?
Driving drunk. Classic.
What's on your arm?
- What the fuck is that? - Jesus, Phil. - You were in the hospital last night.
- I guess so, yeah.
- You okay? - Yeah, Alan. I'm fine.
What the hell is going on? Well, Stu, Stu, this is a good thing. We have a lead now.
Hey, Stu, watch this.
- You ever seen a baby do that?
So, uh, are you sure you're qualified to be taking care of that baby?
What? I've found a baby before.
- You found a baby before?
- Yeah. - Where? - Coffee Bean.
Hey, Phil? I don't think Doug would want us to take the Mercedes.
Relax, we'll be careful.
My dad is crazy about that car. He left Doug in charge...
Alan. We got bigger problems here. Doug could be in the hospital, he could be hurt.
- Let's worry about the car later.
- Uh, guys? Check it out.
Is that the mattress from Doug's room?
PHlL: What the fuck?
Hey, man, what's going on here?
Some asshole threw his bed out the window last night.
- No shit.
- Yeah. Some guys just can't handle Vegas.
It's gonna be okay, Stu.
How the hell did we manage that?
- Here's your car, officers.
- Oh, God. All right, everybody act cool. All right, don't say a word.
- Stu, you got a five?
PHlL: I'll hit you on the way back.
VALET:
Thank you, sir. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You just nailed the baby.
ALAN: Are my glasses okay?
Your glasses are fine, dick.
STU:
Can't you see the fun part in anything?
Yeah, we're stuck in traffic in a stolen police car... ...with a missing child in the back seat.
Which part of this is fun?
- I think the cop-car part's pretty cool.
- Thank you, Alan. It is cool.
Come on.
- Check this out.
STU: Oh, no. No, Phil.
Take it easy. - Just try to call more attention to us. PHlL :
Attention. - Sorry. PHlL:
Move out of the way. I repeat, please disperse.
Phil, stop the car, I wanna get out. Stop the car, I wanna get out. Pull over.
Ma'am, in the leopard dress, you have an amazing rack.
STU: Get off the sidewalk! Get off the sidewalk!
I should have been a fucking cop.
Look, I already told you.
You came in with a mild concussion, some bruised ribs.
No big deal.
Although none of you could articulate how it happened.
Do you remember how many of us were here?
Ah... I don't know. I think it was just you guys.
Definitely no baby.
- And one other guy.
- That's our guy. Was he okay?
Yeah. He was fine. Just whacked out of his mind.
All right, come forward.
All right. There you go.
And cough.
Cough. Cough.
Give me one more.
All right.
Okay, Felix, you can put your robe on. And the nurse will be in here in a minute.
I'll see you after the weekend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Guys, I really gotta go. I'm sorry. I have a surgery up on the fourth floor.
No, I know. But we just need a couple more minutes of your time.
Yeah. Tuck it right in there. I don't want to re-sterilize.
Walk with me.
Okay, here we go.
Patient name, Phil Wenneck, 2:45 a.m. arrival.
Minor concussion, like I said. Some bruising. Pretty standard.
Do you mind if I look? I'm actually a doctor.
Yeah, you said that several times last night.
Okay, this is interesting.
Your blood work came in this morning.
They found a large amount of Ruphylin in your system.
Ruphylin. Roofies. Commonly known as the date-rape drug.
What, so, what are you saying, I was raped last night?
Actually...
I don't think so. But someone did slip you the drug.
I'm not surprised you don't remember anything.
Doc, none of us can remember anything from last night. Remember?
Yeah. How could someone have drugged all of us?
VALSH: I wouldn't worry about it. The stuff's out of your system.
You're gonna be fine.
Wait, wait, wait. Please, doctor.
Is there anything else?
Like, something we may have been talking about... ...or some place we were going?
Actually, there was something.
You guys kept talking about some wedding last night.
Yeah. No shit. Our buddy Doug's getting married tomorrow.
- You know what? I want the 100 back. - No, no.
Easy. You kept talking about some wedding you just came from.
At the, uh, Best Little Chapel.
You kept saying how sick the wedding was and getting all crazy about it.
Okay, I hope this helps. I really have to leave.
Best Little Chapel, do you know where that is?
I do. It's at the corner of Get A Map and Fuck Off.
I'm a doctor, not a tour guide.
Figure it out yourself, okay?
ALAN:
What about the baby? PHlL: Leave him in the car.
We're gonna be five minutes. STU: Whoa, we're not leaving a baby in the car.
- What if they don't remember us?
I'm sor... Excuse me, sir?
Look at these guys. What happened?
You miss me? You miss Eddie? You want more from me?
How are you, my friend? Look at this guy. You're fucking crazy.
What's going on, man?
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something. I know some sick people in my life.
This guy is the craziest, wildest bastard I ever met in my life, man.
- This guy? - This guy is out of his mind. What's going on, you fucking crazy motherfucker?
I thought he was gonna eat my dick.
What happened? No love for Eddie? You don't hug me?
No, no. It's not that, Eddie.
Uh, it's just that we're having a hard time remembering... ...what happened here last night.
Yeah, was there a wedding here? Do you do weddings here?
You are cracking my balls, man.
Obviously we were here. We're looking for our friend Doug.
- Do you remember? - Yeah, the small guy.
Like a monkey. - Yeah. - You saw him?
Of course. Is there anything you can tell us about what may have happened last night?
You don't remember nothing?
- Congratulations, Stu, you got married.
- This... This can't be happening.
- Oh, God. ALAN: Look at that.
I'll tell you one thing, you look seriously happy here, man.
STU: That's it. My life is over.
Stu, it's okay. Look, shit happens. Come on.
Melissa's not gonna know anything about this. - This never happened. I'll take care of it.
Hey, what's all that?
The High Roller package.
It's what you ordered. I have coffee mugs.
- What? EDDlE: You have baseball caps, huh?
And fancy calendars, all with pictures of Stu and Jade.
PHlL: Her name's Jade?
Yeah, and she's beautiful, man. Clean, very tight. Tits like that.
PHlL: That explains the baby. - Oh, Carlos.
- Great. All right. Uh, here's the deal.
We made a mistake last night. We need this marriage annulled.
You do annulments? Of course I do.
It breaks my heart and gonna make me sad... ...but it's no problem.
Good price for you.
I can't do it with just him, though. I need the chick. I need both parties.
Oh, not a problem.
Isn't that great, Stu?
Come on, buddy. She probably knows where Doug is.
- Awesome.
We need her address. She filled out some paperwork, right?
Of course.
Hey. Excuse me. What is the matter with you?
Go and get the paperwork, man. I spend my life waiting for you.
Come on. Okay. I'm going.
- Hey, Phil, what about my dad's car?
- I'm sure Doug has it.
Then I vote we torch the cop car and all this shit with it.
- Torch it? Who are you?
- I don't know, Phil. Apparently I'm a guy who marries complete strangers.
This whole situation is completely fucked.
- These mugs. This hat. This car.
That is why we're torching all of it.
Whoa, I'm a schoolteacher, I got a family, okay?
I'm all for secrecy, but I'm not gonna torch a cop car.
- Fine. I'll do it.
- Can I help?
Yeah, thanks. PHlL: Is it Doug?
Uh, it's Melissa.
- Don't answer. - I have to. She's called twice already!
Don't touch me. Hey, sweetheart, how are you?
There you are. This is the third time I'm trying you.
I know. The reception up here's crazy.
I think it's all the sequoia trees, block the signal. Ugh, I hate that.
So how was it last night?
Ah, it was really fun, actually. It was quiet, but it was a good time.
MELlSSA: That sounds nice. - I'm learning all kinds of vino factoids.
It'd be so cool if I could breast-feed, you know?
Well, listen... ...we're about to go for a tractor ride. PHlL: What the fuck?
I should get going. So pretty. MELlSSA:
- Go, out of the car!
- What was that? They started up the tractor.
I think it backfired.
- Where the hell is he?
PHlL: Hey, easy, easy. I think we're looking for the same guy, okay?
What the hell, man?
MELlSSA: What the fuck, Stu? Is that a baby?
Why would there be a baby? We're at a winery. That's a goat.
Where is he?
I don't know! What are you talking about?
Sir, can you please start the tractor so we can get out of here?
I'm trying to, but we're fucking blocked.
Oh, my God! What the hell is happening, Stu?
- Hey! There's a baby on board!
- Someone just said "baby."
- Get out of the car!
- It's a baby goat. Why you making trouble for my business, man?
- Go away from here.
- Get out of the car! - Phil, he's got a gun! - No shit he's got a gun!
- I gotta call you back.
He shot me! - He shot Eddie! - Fuck this shit!
Go, go, go!
Oh, that was some sick shit! ALAN:
Who were those guys? STU: We're gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay. What the fuck is going on?!
I have no idea.
That's a fake laugh, by the way.
It's got, uh, Ted Danson and Magnum P.I. and that Jewish actor.
Shut up, Alan. - What room was it again?
WOMAN: I know, I did.
I found him, I'll call you back.
Thank God, he's with his father.
I was freaking out.
I missed you, sweetie.
And I miss you.
What the hell happened to you guys?
Actually, we were hoping you could tell us.
What do you mean?
I got up this morning, I went to get coffee... ...and I came back and you were gone.
- Why are you being so quiet?
- I'm not being quiet.
You're so cute.
Yeah, I gotta feed Tyler.
Did you hear that? Baby's name is Tyler.
I thought he looked more like a Carlos too, bud.
Okay, what's up? You guys are acting weird.
- Look, it's Jade, right? - Very funny, Phil.
Right, Jade, uh, ahem, you remember our friend, Doug.
Are you kidding? He was the best man.
Exactly. Well, we can't find him, and we're getting worried.
JADE: Oh, my God, that is so Doug.
I'm gonna go clean him off.
Oh, my God.
What the fuck, man, you gotta hold it together.
- Holy shit. - She is super hot. - You should be proud of yourself.
- She's wearing my grandmother's ring!
- What? - The ring I'm gonna give to Melissa.
You remember, my grandmother's Holocaust ring?
- Fuck. Okay.
- She's wearing it. I didn't know they gave out rings at the Holocaust.
- He's okay. PHlL:
JADE: He was just hungry, he's fine.
- Oh, good. About last night, uh, ahem, do you remember the last time you saw Doug?
Uh, I haven't seen him since the wedding.
What time was that at?
I guess it was around 1, because I had to go back to work and finish my shift.
And then when I got out I headed over to the hotel with Tyler.
And was Doug there then?
I didn't see Doug because you guys were passed out.
The room was a wreck. - So I just curled up next to Stu. PHlL:
I got a question.
Um, you said when your shift ended. Does that mean you're a nurse?
Or a blackjack dealer?
- You know this.
- Mm-hm. Well, technically I'm an escort... ...but stripping's a great way to meet the clients.
- Smart.
- Savvy.
But that's all in the past, now that I married a doctor.
I'm just a dentist.
- Las Vegas Police! Freeze! - Okay.
Shut that baby up!
Shut that baby up! STU: Oh, God!
After we take the mug shots, we bring them down here... ...where they wait to be interviewed by the arresting officers.
Trust me, kids, you do not wanna be sitting on these benches.
We call this place Loserville.
Hello.
- Hey, Tracy! It's Phil. TRACY :
Hey, Phil.
- Where are you guys? - We are at the spa at the hotel.
Cool. We're just getting some sun.
Is Doug around? Of course. Why wouldn't he be?
I'm just wondering why you're calling me.
Um... We made a deal, no talking to girlfriends or wives.
So we're all calling each other's.
TRACY: Okay. What's up?
Uh, you are not gonna believe this. We got comped an extra night at the hotel.
You did?
Yeah. The suite is... It's ridiculous.
It's out of control. There's, like, room service and a butler. I mean, just the works.
We're thinking of spending the night... ...and we're gonna come back in the morning.
You wanna stay an extra night? But the wedding's tomorrow.
That's why we're gonna get up early, and we'll be back in plenty of time.
Okay. Are you sure that's a good idea?
Wenneck, Price, Garner. Room 3.
Okay, Trace, I gotta go.
- Come on, chop-chop. - Okay, spin around.
- Goddamn it. - Wait a second. - I'll go over.
And then just... There we go.
Gentlemen. We've got some good news, and we've got some bad news.
The good news is we found your Mercedes.
See? Yeah, it's over at impound right now.
We picked it up at 5 a.m. this morning... ...parked in the middle of Las Vegas Boulevard.
PHlL: In the middle. That's weird.
- Yeah, that is weird. There was also a note.
It says, uh, "Couldn't find a meter, but here's 4 bucks."
The bad news is... ...we can't get you in front of a judge until Monday morning.
Oh, no, uh, officer, that's just impossible.
No, we need to be in L.A. tomorrow for a wedding.
You stole a police car.
We didn't steal anything. Um, we found it.
Yeah, if anything, we deserve a reward or something, like a trophy.
- I see assholes like you every day. - Every fucking day.
"Let's go to Vegas, we'll all get drunk and laid! - Yeah.
Let's steal a cop car, because it'd be really fucking funny."
Think you gonna get away with it?
Not up in here. - Not up in here!
Sir... ...if I may, um... ...I'm assuming that that squad car belongs to one of you.
Look, I'm not a cop.
I'm no hero.
I'm a schoolteacher.
But if one of my kids went missing on a field trip... ...that would look really bad on me.
- What are you getting at?
- Yeah, Phil, what are you getting at?
No one wants to look bad.
We gotta get to a wedding... ...and you guys don't need people talking about... ...how some obnoxious tourists borrowed your squad car last night.
But look, the point is, I think we can work out a deal. Discreetly of course, ma'am.
What do you say?
FRANKLlN: Let me ask you a question:
Do, uh, any of you gentlemen have a heart condition or anything like that?
Uh, no.
Okay, kids, you're in for a real treat today.
These gentlemen have kindly volunteered to demonstrate... ...how a stun gun is used to subdue a suspect.
- That's right.
- Wait a sec. What? Now, there's two ways to use a stun gun.
Up close and personal.
- What the fuck? - Or you can shoot it from a distance.
Do I have any volunteers? You wanna come up here and do some shooting?
Huh? All right, how about you, young lady?
All right. Let's go, handsome, come on.
Not you, fat Jesus, slide it on back.
You, pretty boy.
Fat Jesus. FRANKLlN: All right, now, it's real simple.
You don't really wanna do this.
You can do this.
Just focus. Don't listen to this maniac. Let's think this through.
Finish him!
Right in the nuts! That was beautiful.
- Well done. Give her a hand, everybody.
Good job. Well done. Good job.
Good. Hey, we got one more charge left.
Anybody wanna do some shooting up here?
How about you, big man? Come on up here.
Okay, same instructions.
There you go. That's the stuff. I like the intensity.
Eye of the tiger.
You're holding 50,000 volts, little man. Don't be afraid to ride the lightning.
In the face! In the face!
Oh, he's still up. He's still up.
All right, everybody relax, take it easy.
We've seen it before. He just needs a little extra charge.
There we go.
Some of these big boys, you gotta give them two shots.
All right, kids, who wants to get their fingerprints done, huh?
Come on, let's go.
STU:
Fuck those guys, you hear me?
That was bullshit. I'm telling everybody we stole a cop car.
- They let us go, who cares?
- I care! You can't just do that.
You can't just tase people because you think it's funny.
That's police brutality.
I'm getting a soda. Do you guys want anything? No.
My man doesn't shut up.
Alan, you okay?
I'm just worried.
What if something happened to Doug? Something bad.
Come on, you can't think like that.
I mean, what if he's dead?
I can't afford to lose anybody close to me again. It hurts too much.
- I was so upset when my grandpa died.
- Oh, I'm s... How'd he die?
- World War Il.
- Died in battle? No, he was skiing in Vermont. It was just during World War Il.
Alan... ...Doug is fine.
I'll tell you another thing, 6-1 odds our car is beat to shit.
Stu, not now.
No, how much do you wanna bet it's fucked beyond recognition?
That's enough. Alan's seriously worried, okay?
Sorry, Alan.
You know what? We'll search the car for clues and everything's gonna be okay.
PHlL: Oh, shit. I can't watch.
STU: Not looking.
All right. PHlL:
It's gonna be all right.
- Anything? STU:
Hmm, I got a cigar.
Oh, I found, uh... These are some black shoes. - They women's shoes?
- Whose are those? - I don't know.
It's a men's size 6. - That's weird.
- What is this, a snakeskin?
Oh, come on!
- That's a used condom, Alan.
STU: Gross, it's wet.
Come on. I got jizz on me.
Jesus Christ, guys! STU:
Oh, my God.
All right, what the fuck, man? We gotta get this shit together, guys!
What was that?
It's in the trunk.
- Doug's in the trunk.
PHlL: Oh, fuck! Holy shit!
Open it! Open it! PHlL:
Please! Please! Please stop!
I'm with you, I'm with you!
- You gonna fuck on me?
- Nobody's gonna fuck on you!
We're on your side. I hate Godzilla!
He destroys cities!
This isn't your fault. I'll get you some pants.
PHlL:
STU:
I have internal bleeding. Somebody call 911.
That was some fucked up shit. Who was that guy?
Guys, there's something I need to tell you.
Last night on the roof, before we went out... ...I slipped something in our Jägermeister.
- What?
- I'm sorry, I fudged up, guys.
- You drugged us?
- No, I didn't drug you. I was told it was ecstasy.
Well, who told you it was ecstasy?
The guy I bought it from at the liquor store.
Why would you give us ecstasy?
I wanted everybody to have a good time and I knew you guys wouldn't take it.
It was just one hit each. I used to do three hits a night.
But it wasn't ecstasy, Alan, it was roofies!
ALAN: You think I knew that, Stu?
The guy I bought it from seemed like a real straight shooter.
You mean the drug dealer at the liquor store wasn't a good guy?
Let's just calm down. You fucking calm down!
He drugged us. I lost a tooth. I married a whore.
- How dare you! She's a nice lady.
- You are such a fucking moron. - Your language is offensive.
STU:
Fuck you! All right, let's just take a deep breath, okay?
Seriously, this is a good thing.
At least it's not some stranger who drugged us for God knows what reason.
Yeah, you're right, Phil, it's totally a good thing.
We're so much better off now.
Here's something I would like to remind you two of:
Our best friend Doug is probably facedown in a ditch right now... ...with a meth-head butt-fucking his corpse.
- That's highly unlikely.
- It's true. Does not help. All right, let's get our shit together, guys.
Let's go back to the hotel, and I'm gonna make a couple calls.
Maybe Doug's back there. Maybe he's asleep.
Come on. Let's go.
- Stu? Little help?
STU:
Ow. - Oh, God. Oh, God, are you okay?
Wait, guys. Guys.
What about the tiger? What if he got out?
I keep forgetting about the goddamn tiger.
How the fuck did he get in there?
I don't know, because I don't remember.
Shh. Stu. Stu, keep it down.
Because one of the, uh, side effects of, uh, roofies is memory loss.
You are literally too stupid to insult.
- Thank you.
{PHlL COLLlNS' "IN THE AlR TONlGHT" PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS} Hey, come on.
Did we leave the music on?
Don't make any sudden movements.
- Who the hell are you?
- No, who are you? MAN: Quiet, quiet.
Mike Tyson?
This is my favourite part coming up right now.
Need a chorus line, guys.
One more time, guys.
Why did you do that?
Mr. Tyson would like to know why is his tiger in your bathroom.
Hold on, that was completely unnecessary.
I'm a huge fan. When you knocked out Holmes, that was...
Explain.
All right, look, we were drugged last night. We have no memory of what happened.
STU: It's true.
We got in all kinds of trouble last night and now we can't find our friend.
If you wanna kill us, go ahead because I don't care anymore.
- What are you talking about?
Why the fuck would you wanna steal his tiger?
We tend to do dumb shit when we're fucked up.
- I don't believe these guys, man.
- Wait, how did you guys find us?
One of you dropped your jacket. Found it in the tigers' cage this morning.
That's Doug's.
Yeah, Doug. His wallet and his room key is in there.
- No, that's our missing friend. LEONARD:
- Did you guys see him?
MlKE: I was fast asleep.
Because if he was up, this wouldn't have gone down so smoothly.
Maybe one of the tigers ate his ass like Omar.
Respect.
Wha...? What happened to Omar?
Oh, don't worry about Omar, he's not with us no more.
Okay, I know this is asking a lot... ...but do you think we could go to your house and look around... ...see if there's any clues?
Absolutely. How else you think we're gonna get the tiger back anyway?
- Come on, champ.
We're not gonna put it in the Bentley. You brought it here, you bring it back.
What you think, about 40 minutes?
Don't make me come back for him.
- That was Mike Tyson. - Yeah, no shit that was Mike Tyson.
I'm just saying, he's still got it.
Bud, are you okay?
Fuck, where'd he get him?
This does not seem fair.
PHlL: It's Rock, Paper, Scissors.
There's nothing more fair. - Alan should do it.
- Alan took a punch from Mike Tyson. Come on.
Why are you peppering the steak? You don't know if tigers like pepper.
Tigers love pepper.
Phil, just do it. You should do it.
I would, but you lost. It wouldn't be right.
Okay, I jammed five roofies in there. Just go in there and throw it in to him.
Fine.
Make sure he eats the whole thing.
Hey, kitty.
Hey, sweetie, it's okay. I got a little snack for you.
Real important that you eat this, okay?
Yeah, just have a little...
What do we do now?
We wait.
What do tigers dream of When they take a little tiger snooze?
Do they dream of mauling zebras Or Halle Berry in her Catwoman suit?
Don 't you worry your pretty striped head
We're gonna get you back to Tyson And your cozy tiger bed
And then we're gonna find Our best friend Doug
And then we're gonna give him A best-friend hug
Doug Doug  Doug, Dougie, Dougie, Doug, Doug
But if he's been murdered By crystal-meth tweakers
Well, then we're shit out of luck
By the way, we're all gonna die.
ALAN: Watch it! STU:
His nose. That's his nose.
Hey, guys, when's the next Halley's comet?
- Who cares, man? - Do you know, Stu?
I don't think it's for, like, another 60 years or something.
- But it's not tonight, right? - No, I don't think so.
But you don't know for sure?
No.
I got this cousin who saw one. He said it blew his mind.
I wanna make sure I never, ever miss out on a Halley's Comet.
So if you guys know if there's gonna be one...
PHlL: Fuck it!
Stu! Stu, it got me!
Stu! You got clawed!
I can't do it. PHlL: Get your fucking hand back in there... ...and steer the car.
- I'm too nervous.
STU: Alan. We need you, buddy.
Daddy's gonna kill me.
- That's it. PHlL:
That's good. Keep it straight.
- You're late.
- Whatever, man. We had to push it the last mile.
Come on in. Mike's got something he wants to show you.
That thing's out of control, man.
When we got back, we took a look at the security cameras.
Great.
- Oh, it's Doug. - Oh, thank God he's alive.
That's our buddy. That's who we've been missing.
We're all best friends.
Why don't you just pay attention? I don't have all night.
Yeah, of course.
That's me, I'm on TV.
I've never been on TV before.
Really? Really, Alan?
STU: You're gonna overflow the pool, man.
- Maybe... Should I wait outside?
- I think that's a good idea, Alan.
Don't touch anything out there, either.
You know what? He's not our good fr... We don't know him that well.
By the way, where you get that cop car from?
We, uh, stole it from these dumb-ass cops.
Nice.
You know, I just have to say... ...I have never seen a more beautiful, elegant, just regal creature.
PHlL: Check it out. Stu.
Fuck this tiger. STU: Oh, my God.
Oh, shit. - Who does shit like that, man?
Someone who has a lot of issues, obviously.
That's all we got.
This was hugely helpful. Really.
Because now we know that our buddy Doug... ...was with us at 3:30, totally alive.
Thanks again, champ.
And, uh, again, we are so sorry we stole your tiger.
Don't worry about it, man. Like you said, we all do dumb shit when we're fucked up.
- I told you he'd get it.
You know, everyone says Mike Tyson is such a badass... ...but I think he's kind of a sweetheart.
I think he's mean.
I think it's officially time we call Tracy.
Hallelujah. Finally, Phil says something that makes sense.
We don't have much of a choice. And maybe she's heard from Doug.
That's what I been saying this whole time.
We just need to be completely honest.
We don't have to tell her everything.
We can leave out the stuff... ...about me marrying a hooker.
Just stay focused on Doug.
- What am I gonna tell my dad?
- Alan, relax. It's just the inside.
Come on. I got a guy in L.A. who's great with interiors.
- Oh, Jesus! STU:
- Are you guys okay?
I know that guy.
Get out of the car. Please.
W... Wait. Those are the guys that shot Eddie.
I want my purse back, assholes.
- What? Your purse? - That's not a purse, it's a satchel.
It's a purse.
Okay? And you steal from wrong guy.
Wait a second, wait a second. We stole from you?
We don't remember anything that happened last night... ...so help us out a little here.
Well, apparently you guys met at a craps table late last night.
You were on a heater, and he played your hot streak.
He ended up winning just under 80 grand.
No shit?
Eighty grand is nice.
Okay, that's good.
He put the chips in his purse, and then you guys took off with it.
That doesn't sound like us.
Mine had $80,000 inside.
And this one? Nothing.
Hey, there are Skittles in there.
Don't let the beard fool you.
He's a child. It's funny because he's fat.
Now, look, this was obviously a very simple misunderstanding.
Alan picked up the wrong purse, it's no big deal.
Okay, if it's, "No big deal," why, when I come after you guys... ...he starts screaming like crazy and throw me in trunk?
What, I did that?
Yeah, you said he was you’re lucky charm... ...and you want to take him home with you.
- Lucky charm. - Oh, it's just funny.
Fuck you.
If you want to see your friend again, you get me my 80 grand.
- What? - Our friend?
- You have Doug?
- Doug!
You chill out, goatee!
- Okay, okay.
All right, fine, fine.
- What do you want? Not so good now.
Quid pro quo, douche bag.
Look, we're very sorry. But this is an easy fix.
- Alan, where's his purse?
- I don't know. - It's in the hotel room, right?
- Yeah, we can get it.
We can get you the... We can even write you a check right now.
No chance. Cash only.
- There's a person in there.
CHOW: Boring.
Take nap.
Doug, it's okay. - You kidnapped our friend!
Kidnapper!
Run me over.
Bring money to Big Rock in Mojave Desert at dawn.
- What? - Toodle-oo, motherfucker.
Well, at least take the bag off his head!
Come on, get out of here.
Guys, I'm telling you, I looked for it this morning before we left.
Stu, how much you got in the bank?
About 10 grand. I was gonna use it for the wedding.
You're already married, so we're good there.
Besides, enough with Melissa, she's the worst.
Yeah, Doug told me she had sex with a pilot or something.
It was a bartender on a cruise. What is wrong with you people?
- Ew. Alan, did you just eat sofa pizza?
- Yes.
What are we gonna do? We are so fucked.
ALAN: Hey, guys?
- Did you find it?
But check this out.
Change only, 10,000.
- Hey, uh, these seats taken?
- No, feel free.
All right, let's play some blackjack!
That's it.
Shut up, bitches.
- I'll stick.
- Oh, fuck you! Fuck you!
Splitting fives.
- Too many.
I don't even know you, but I'm gonna tell you that's dumb.
Oh! Okay, come on. He can't lose.
I think the pit boss is watching him.
- Oh, my God. - Are you okay?
I'm such a klutz. I get so nervous when I gamble. I'm so silly.
- It happens. - Whoa. Hold on a beat, okay?
- Let's just take it easy. This is my wife.
- It's hurting. STU: Make sure...
- You all right? JADE: I don't know.
I think you're fine. Let's go. - Really?
I'm sorry, she's had a little too much to drink.
Thanks, buddy.
STU: And 100, 200, 300, 400.
With all this, that's $82,400.
Oh, goddamn it. I don't fucking believe it.
Whoo! - Alan, you're the man.
We should come back next week, take the whole city down.
Oh, I'm free next week.
Or we could just focus on getting Doug back, right now.
Uh, you know what? Next week's no good, the Jonas Brothers are in town.
But any week after that is totally fine.
I think it's safe to say that our luck has officially turned around, guys.
We are back, baby.
We are fucking back.
We're back. Classic.
We are back, we are back PHlL: That's right.
We are getting Doug back
And we're the three best friends That anybody could have
We're the three best friends That anyone could have We're the three best friends That anyone can have
And we'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever Leave each other
We're the best three friends That anybody could have
I mean, the three best friends That anybody could have
PHlL: Now what?
- Give him the signal.
- What signal?
- Flash your lights.
Let him know it's on. - What's on?
- The deal.
Of course it's on. We just drove 30 miles into the desert. He knows it's on.
Phil, just do something.
Fine.
- Oh, shit. ALAN:
All right, let's go.
Funny fat guy fall on face.
You okay?
All right, we got the money.
Eighty grand, cash.
Throw it over. Then I give you Doug.
First of all, good morning. And we didn't catch your name last night.
Mr. Chow. Leslie Chow.
Mr. Chow, it is a pleasure. My name is Stu.
And we would very much appreciate an opportunity to see Doug... ...before we give you the money, just to verify that he's okay.
- Of course, Stu.
- Oh, thank God.
- Okay. See, he fine. Now give me money... ...or I shoot him, and I shoot all you motherfuckers.
And then we take it. Your choice, bitches.
- Give him the money, Stu. - Okay.
MAN: It's all there.
All right, take it easy.
CHOW: Ta-da.
Is this some kind of joke? Who the hell is this?
That is not Doug.
What you talking about, Willis? That him.
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Chow. That's not our friend.
That's... - The Doug we're looking for is a white.
I told you you had the wrong guy, little boy.
Damn, Alan, what the fuck you got me into?
- You know him?
- This is the guy... ...that sold me the bad drugs. - How you doing?
- I didn't sell you no fucking bad drugs.
- Wait. He sold you the Ruphylin? - Ruphylin?
I sold you that Ru...? Wha...?
- Who gives a shit?
Where is Doug? - I am Doug.
- Your name's Doug? - Yes, I'm Doug.
His name's Doug too. Ha. Classic mix-up.
Come on.
Hey, Chow. You gave us the wrong Doug.
Not my problem.
No, fuck that shit. Now, you give us our 80 grand back and take him with you!
- No. Come on.
I'll be your Doug. - Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, I take him back.
Right after you suck on these little Chinese nuts.
- Ah. That's nasty.
How that sound?
Unh, pshh. - So long, gay boys.
- Wait a second.
DOUG: He's a nasty little motherfucker.
Did you ever get any ecstasy? DOUG: No, I ain't got no fucking ecstasy.
- Goddamn it!
Gosh darn it!
- Shit!
ALAN:
TRACY : Hello?
- Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil.
Phil, where the hell are you guys?
Thanks for the lift back to town.
- I got a question for you. - What's up?
How did you wind up in Chow's car?
That crazy asshole kidnapped me yesterday.
Okay, but why? I mean, why you?
He thought I was with you guys because we were hanging over at the Bellagio.
- What?
- We were at the Bellagio?
We were shooting craps. You don't remember?
No. No, we don't remember.
Because some dick drug dealer sold him Ruphylin and told him it was ecstasy.
Ruphylin. There you go with that word. Ruphylin.
What the hell is a Ruphylin? Wow, you are the world's shittiest drug dealer.
Ruphylin, for your information, is the date rape drug. You sold Alan roofies.
Oh, shit. I must have mixed up the bags. My fault, Alan.
Damn, Marshall gonna be pissed off at me on that one.
- Whatever.
- It's funny, because just the other day... ...me and my boy, we was wondering why they even call them roofies.
- You know what I'm talking about?
Why not floories, right?
Because when you take them... ...you're more likely to end up on the floor than the roof.
What about groundies? That's a good new name for them.
Or, how about rapies?
- Wait, what did you just say?
- Rapies. Not you. Doug, what did you say before?
I said groundies.
No, before that.
You said, "You're more likely to wind up on the floor than..."
- Listen, Trace, I'm really sorry. I...
TRACY :
- Tracy, it's Stu.
Stu. Talk to me. What's going on?
Uh, nothing. Don't listen to Phil. He's completely out of his mind.
He's probably still drunk from last night.
Where's Doug?
STU: He is paying the bill. We just had a delicious brunch.
We're in a hurry to get back, so we gotta get going.
- Okay, we'll see you soon.
- What the fuck, man?
- I know where Doug is.
STU: I don't know, man. It just hit me.
You remember when we saw Doug's mattress impaled on that statue?
- Yeah, we threw it out the window.
- No, impossible. You can't open windows in Vegas hotels.
Well, then how did it get...?
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa, wait. What's going on?
- Doug was trying to signal someone.
- Holy shit. STU: Yes.
How did you figure that out? - Doug made me realize it.
- Doug? - Uh, not our Doug. Black Doug.
- Hey, hey, easy with that shit.
- Sorry. Can someone tell me where white Doug is?
- He's on the roof, Alan.
- Yes. He's on the roof. We must have taken him up there as a prank... ...so he'd wake up on the roof.
- Like that time in summer camp.
We moved his sleeping bag out in the jetty at the lake?
Ha, ha, ha. Which was hilarious.
It's not so funny now, though, because we forgot where we put him.
You guys are retarded, you know that?
- Holy shit. You think he's still up there?
- There's only one way to find out.
PHlL: Doug!
- Doug!
Doug, you up here, buddy?
Where you at, Doug?
Hey, guys! He's over here!
ALAN: Hey, I found him!
He's okay.
You're okay. Ha, ha, ha!
Oh, God. We gotta go, buddy.
Come on. Oh, we have been looking everywhere for you.
- What the fuck is going on?
We can explain everything, but right now we gotta go.
- Hey, bud.
You okay? - No. Not okay.
You look good, you got some colour.
- I'm getting married today.
- Yes, you are. That's why you need to focus and do everything we say.
Because, frankly, you're wasting a little bit of time right now.
You fucking asshole!
Oh, ow! God. - It's okay.
It's not your fault, Doug. - Don't touch me. Shut up.
Just get me home.
Just get me home.
STU: What about the one after that?
You cannot be serious.
Oh, goddamn it. - What? - Every flight to L.A. is booked.
- What about Burbank? - Sold out.
Oh, fuck! We can't drive there, the wedding starts in three and a half hours.
- Alan, where's the car?
ALAN: It's on its way.
You know what? We can drive there. We can make it.
- Just give me one second.
PHlL: We will leave without you.
- Is he missing a tooth? - Yeah.
- Hey. Hey, thanks for helping out last night. That was so awesome.
Listen, Jade, I...
Look, you don't have to say it. I totally understand.
- This whole thing was stupid.
It was stupid, wasn't it?
- This is yours.
- Oh, thank you. I can't believe I gave my grandmother's Holocaust ring to someone I just met.
- What was I thinking?
- You were really fucked up. Clearly.
- You did pull out your own tooth.
I pulled out my tooth?
Why did I pull out my own tooth?
Alan bet you that you weren't a good enough dentist... ...to pull out your own tooth.
Okay. Heh.
- Of course he did.
Yeah. Clearly. Yeah.
That's victory, right there.
ALAN:
It needs to go down. - It's good. Get in.
- Alan, it's fine.
- No, I gotta get it down first. PHlL:
- Don't mess the car up.
You're gonna mess the car up.
- Hey, what are you doing next weekend?
- I don't know. Working.
Why? I was thinking maybe I'd come back and take you out to dinner.
Really? Like a date?
Yeah. Like a date. Only, one that hopefully I'll remember.
Sounds good.
- Stu.
Come on. - Stu. Come on.
I gotta go.
Okay.
- Bye.
- All right, let's go.
At least the trip wasn't a total disaster.
- What makes you say that?
- When I woke up on the roof... ...I happened to find $80,000 worth of Bellagio chips in my pocket.
- Oh! STU: Oh, my God!
Looks like we're going home with some money, boys.
ALAN: Here he comes. That's him.
- Hey, Neeco! NEECO: Hey.
- Whoa, look out. - Oh, shit. ALAN:
- Thanks, Neeco. NEECO: You got it, man.
STU: Who the hell was that guy? ALAN:
Sorry, MapQuest took us on a really crazy route.
- How's my hair? - It looks good.
- Is it cool like Phil's?
She looks beautiful, man.
Sorry I'm late.
Vegas.
Where were you? And why are you so red?
Honey, it's a long story.
MlNISTER: We are gathered here today... ...because of the strength of love and of promises kept.
All I know is I am so sorry.
And I promise for as long as we're married... ...to never, ever put you through anything like this again.
Can you forgive me?
- Daddy. - Hey, my man.
Excuse me, but I'm expecting my husband any minute.
Oh, that's very funny.
Come here.
How was your soccer game?
- Stu? You avoiding me?
- Hey. Melissa.
Oh, my God. What happened to your tooth?
Have you met Alan? Tracy's brother.
Okay.
Ow. That is disgusting.
Well, there was a snafu when we stopped...
I called that bed and breakfast in Napa.
They said they had no record of you even checking in.
That's because we didn't go to Napa.
- Stu. What the fuck is going on?
- We went to Las Vegas. Oh, really?
Las Vegas? Why would you go to Las Vegas?
My friend was getting married. That's what guys do.
- Okay, that's not what you do.
- Really? Well, then why did I do it, huh? Because I did it.
Why'd I do it?
All you want me to do is what you want me to do.
I'm sick of doing what you want.
In a healthy relationship, a guy should be able to do what he wants.
- That is not how this works!
STU: Oh, good. Because whatever this is ain't working for me!
MELlSSA: Oh, really?
Yeah. Since when?
Since you fucked that waiter on your cruise last June.
- You told me it was a bartender.
- Oh, you're right. I stand corrected. It was a bartender.
You fucked a bartender.
You're an idiot.
You're... You...
You're such a bad person.
Like, all the way through to your core.
Alan, shall we dance?
Let's do this.
- It was a real pleasure meeting you.
- I'm getting my bartender's license.
No, thank you.
Dougie... ...I gotta tell you, man, this was a gorgeous wedding.
- I give it six months.
- You're a dick.
I don't know what to say. Thanks for the bachelor party, I guess?
Yeah. I just wish we could actually remember some of it.
- Hey, guys? Look what I found.
- Whoa, that's my camera.
- It was in the back seat of the car.
- Oh, Go... Are there photos on it?
Yeah. Some of it's even worse than we thought.
- No fucking way. Give me that.
Wait, wait, wait.
We look at these pictures together, okay? One time.
- And then we delete the evidence.
- I say we delete it right now.
Are you nuts?
I wanna find out how I wound up in the hospital.
- Yeah, it's in there.
- Guys, one time.
- Deal? - Deal.
Oh, dear Lord!
On June 21st, 1974, Ricardo Morales had breakfast with
Liliana Colotto for the last time.
For the rest of his life he'd remember every single detail of that morning.
Planning their first vacation, drinking tea with lemon, for his nagging cough, with his usual
lump and a half of sugar.
The fresh berry jam he'd never taste again.
The flowers on her nightgown, and specially her smile.
That smile like the sunrise blending in with the sunlight on her left cheek...
No, no, no!
Please, don't!
"I FEAR"
The gates of Heaven have opened, and an angel got out.
- Esposito... - Bye, baby.
Look what the cat dragged in.
How are you, Counselor?
And you, Lieutenant? Is the boss here?
Go right in, Your Honor. Thanks, Reverend.
You look good and rested.
What a fucking asshole!
Takes one to know one.
The gates of Heaven have opened...
Your Highness.
What a surprise!
- May I? - What brings you here?
Just wanted to chat.
You busy?
Jut overpreparing for a hearing. Coffee?
I'm asking just in case retirement made you healthy.
Mariano!
Yes, Your Honor.
Bring us two of those great coffees from the cafe.
I'm typing a deposition.
A deposition?
Meet Mr. Benjamin Esposito, our recently retired royal honoris causa, and an old friend.
Mariano, our spring-summer intern.
Not bad, huh?
Here, bring some petit-fours and get yourself a candy bar.
I'll take extra cream.
That's right, you're not well.
What was your problem again?
Extra cream for the man, he has an age problem.
Yes, ma'am.
Wait.
Is it important?
No.
Leave the door open, son.
Come on, sit down.
What do you know about writing novels?
I've been writing all my life.
Take a look in the archive.
Oh, the case files.
How many pages will your file be?
Does it have a cover?
A little encouragement would be nice.
What should I do? Act like some unwanted retiree who wants to help out?
Serve coffee?
I want to write, so what?
I want to write about the Morales case.
I don't know why, it's been on my mind.
We actually never talked about it.
Why was that?
With your handwriting, it'll be unreadable.
Wait, look.
My biggest problem is that I've started fifty times and never got past the 5th line.
At this rate, I'll spend my whole pension fund on spiral notebooks.
Come here, give me a hand.
Here, let me.
I can't...
It weighs a ton.
I can't believe it. The old Olivetti.
It was in storage.
I think it's 100 years old.
Think they fixed the "A"?
The "A" is for pansies.
Take it. Dinosaurs have to stick together.
Now I'm out of excuses.
I'll have to write.
But where do I start?
Wherever you remember the most.
It was over 20 years ago. Which part comes back most often?
That's the image you should start with.
It's a start.
This is your new boss, fresh out of Harvard.
Miss Irene Menendez Hastings.
"Hastings"
It's pronounced "Hastings."
Sorry.
Hastings, the new clerk.
Your deputy, Benjamin Esposito.
Actually I went to Cornell, not Harvard.
Pablo Sandoval, deputy clerk, your humblest servant.
Hey!
Are you here?
Yes, it's just that...
I remember plenty of beginnings, but I'm not sure they have to do with the story.
Then start at the beginning and stop dwelling on it.
Blood Bank, good morning.
Mr. Esposito...
The 25th called. A homicide.
Court 18. It's their turn.
They said it's rape and murder.
Court 18.
Good morning.
Hi, fellas.
Good morning.
Ma'am, did a saint die this morning?
Why?
Because an angel in mourning just walked in the door.
Ah, no.
It's just a trick we angels have to look 5 pounds lighter.
Can you bring in the Chavez file?
Of course.
You smooth fucker.
Why?
You have a compliment ready the moment she walks in the door.
How do you do it? Well, I may dress like a toad, but I'm actually Prince Charming.
- Mr. Esposito! - What?!
Counselor Romano...
He told them it was our turn.
Counselor Romano? Tell him Sheriff Esposito is gonna fuck him up.
- Okay - Come back here.
Three hours thinking of what to say, she opens the door and...
I freeze up.
It's easier for me, I'm not in love.
Neither am I, moron.
Go on.
I want you to get the files and put them on this side.
All together, it's simple enough.
Romano, what did you tell the Precinct?
It's your turn.
We're alternating.
We got another case, what's the problem?
A mini-mart robbery, smart-ass. Alternating similar cases.
What do you want me to do?
Ask Judge Fortuna.
I want a solution, not two problems.
Why is asking me a problem?
It's not that.
It's just silly to bother you with something trivial like this, if we can handle it ourselves.
Strictly speaking, it's your turn.
And hurry up, or you'll find a wake instead of a crime scene.
What's up, Baez?
Still here. And you?
Tired of being happy.
You look happy.
As a dog with two tails.
I just love it when that moron sends me to see a dead girl
Come on in.
Morons are a dime a dozen.
Quiet, easy-going ones who know they're morons.
Live and let live.
They're useless but harmless.
They don't bother. - How are you, Inspector? - Talking about you.
Then there are morons who think they're geniuses.
They shit everywhere and someone has to wipe their asses.
Of those morons I know not one, but two.
The judge and my buddy at Court 18, who's either a moron, a son of a bitch, or both.
It was his turn, so I'm asking you to tell the Judge.
Tell him I have nothing to do with...
Liliana Colotto, 23 years old, teacher,
Recently married to Ricardo Morales, bank clerk.
The old lady mentioned two builders working on the terrace in number 3, but they haven't shown up in 2 days because of the rain.
Sure she didn't see them? She says no.
I'll go see the husband.
See you, Esposito. I'll go with you.
Good afternoon,
Ricardo Morales?
That way.
- Ricardo Morales? - Yes, that's me.
Inspector Baez, Federal Police.
Anyone else have a key to your home?
See any strangers around the last few days?
The neighbor said you came home every day at lunchtime.
Out of the way, isn't it? Any reason in particular?
Sorry, I didn't get that.
We had a habit, a routine.
We liked watching The Three Stooges together.
She thought they were funny.
You'll have to come with me to the morgue.
We'll do the best we can,
I know it's unpleasant.
What is wrong with this typewriter?
Could you please get rid of it? I can't take it anymore.
- Who will want it? - I don't know.
Just get it out of my sight.
Okay, Benja, see if you like this.
With this statement,
I, Criminal JudgeRaimundo Fortuna Lacalle, hereby declare myself completely insane and incapable...
That's wrong.
Give it here. It goes like this:
Pursuant to articles 141, 142 and 143 of the Civil Code,
MY RULlNG -in capital letters- is that Raimundo Fortuna Lacalle, is mentally ill, legally-speaking, insane, suffering from chronic delirium and is therefore unable to carry out his functions as a civil servant."
How are things, Miss? Plenty of signatures?
Yes. We have the Nicolosi case.
No big deal, Your Honor.
Witness statements, nothing more.
Very good.
Sorry, there's one file left,Your Honor.
Thank you.
Hello, Your Honor.
- How are you? - Fine, you?
- Benjamin, Pablo... Ma'am. - Hello.
Hey, Benjamin... just to show you Court 18 is acting in good faith, remember you were upset the other day over getting a case?
Well, the case has been solved.
Two builders working in number 3.
They're under arrest in the 25th.
Whenever you have a chance, you can bring them in to question them.
Hold on...
What builders?
Their names are...
Jacinto Caceres, Bolivian, 35 years old.
Juan Robles, 34.
At least he's Argentinean.
I'm blown away, Romano.
Keep this up and I'll give Court 18 all the hard cases.
Bad news for you, son.
Please, sir.
Always happy to help out.
Esposito, how are you?
Romano warned you I was coming?
I was already typing the report.
You'll get the guys tomorrow: it's them, they signed a confession.
Monday at the latest.
Let me in.
Sergeant Sicora has to authorize it.
Sicora is about to eata plate full of shit. really,
You wanna go join him?
Go right ahead.
Two for the price of one.
Well?
Are you Caceres?
No, I'm Robles, he's Caceres.
Caceres, It's okay.
You stupid son of a bitch!
Are you fucking sick or what?
You arrested two nobodies!Nobodies!
They weren't even there!
Let them go, what do I care?
You ordered it beat the hell out of them!
Know where I'm going? To file a complaint!
We'll see who saves your ass this time!
Fuck your complaint!
Don't worry, you're going to.
Go file it.
All this fuss over two lousy blacks!
Your eyes will be black when I'm done with them!
Knock it off!
You better check the wanted ads.
You'll never set foot here again!
You don't know who you're fucking with!
You have no idea.
Benjamin...
It's okay,
I'm going to file a complaint. I'll be right back.
Fine by me.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
- Did you see Sandoval? - He left.
- Where? - Down Talcahuano.
This country is upside down.
You're upside down.
How can you defend this demagogue president of ours?
Watch what you say,you'll get into trouble.
Attention, everybody, please.
Chief Justice Benjamin Esposito just walked in the door.
Hail, Your Honor.
Oh come on...
How much does he owe?
Nothing, nothing at all,
I pay for my own drinks, you know that.
Besides, it's early. What's the big deal?
I'll pay for it, here I go.
That's it. No no, I have money...
It's paid.
Fine. In that case, Mr. Esposito can buy everybody a round...
No no...
Thanks!
Hands off, hands off, you're not the boss in here, don't embarrass me in front of my friends, got it?
I'll never spot you money again. Why do you keep screwing around?
Okay, okay, let's go. Slowly, everything's fine.
It's fine.
We're leaving.
Come on.
I'm going... well, see you.
Here we go. Goodbye!
My jacket.
I've got it.
See you, Emilio.
Bye...
Why don't you two speak? You're his wife and this is his home..
You bring him at this hour, I don't know where he's been... You bring him now, I don't know what to do.
It's early, you should thank me.
You can't drop him off like this. It's your problem.
Mine?
You brought him like this.
You mean it's my fault?
Who is it?
Benjamin Espósito.
Who?
From the courts, remember?
Pretty, wasn't she?
Very.
I really am sorry for those guys.
They should be getting out by now. habia que esperar a que They had to be checked by forensics for that lawsuit I mentioned.
No, keep looking.
That way you'll get to know her better.
Here's another album.
I look at her picturesall day long
I know I'm in denial, but... it helps me go onuntil we find the guy.
That's when she graduated.
Then she came from Chivilcoy and moved in with her aunt.
She worked in a school in Almagro, that's how we met.
She used to pay her billsat the bank.
I still don't know where I got the courage to talk to her.
Tell me one thing.
When we get this guy, what will he get?
Rape and homicide. He'll get life.
We don't have the death penalty.
I don't agree with the death penalty.
Me neither.
I thought maybe for you it could serve as retribution.
Retribution? Will they rape him and beat him to death?
No, they'll give him an injection and he'll take a nap.
It's not fair.
I'd gladly trade places with him.
Those are from whenshe was 17 or 18.
That's the spring picnic in Chivilcoy.
Ever been there?
No.
I have, she took me to visit her folks.
Let him grow old.
Live a life full of nothing.
What is it?
Nothing...
Did she have any brothers?
No, why?
Do you know who this is?
He's in several. Looking at her.
I showed Liliana this system, otherwise, years pass and you forget who's in the photo.
True...
Laporta, Rodriguez, Cardozo, Simone...
Here it is.
Gómez, Isidoro Gómez.
Well?
I always thought the photo thing was a bit crazy.
Yeah, but I think... it's the look in their eyes.
That's the key.
You see this kid looking at this woman...
Worshipping her.
The eyes...
Speak...
They bullshit too, they should keep quiet.
Sometimes it's better not to look.
What?
We never talked about this case.
When did you come back from Jujuy?
In '85.
Why now?
Better than planting begonias...
Why?
Because I've been sidetracked for over 20 years.
Courts, cases, friends, pranks,
A marriage, several affairs...
I got sidetracked.
And now that I'm retired, nothing sidetracks me.
I was in a bar the other night and I saw myself having dinner alone... and I didn't like myself.
I know it doesn't happen to you.
I'm not asking you to understand.
And in trying to... find the reasons, the moments...
Everything
leads me Morales.
It's as if my life had...
Answer it. It's Alfonso, I'll call him back.
Answer it, I'll wait. I'll call him back.
It's no problem, answer it.
I'm finishing up here,I'll be right there.
Start without me,I'll be right there.
IHi?I Good evening.
Does Isidoro Gomez live there? Yes...
- Is he home?
- No, he doesn't live here anymore.
No?
No, he moved away, to Buenos Aires.
Ah... Buenos Aires?
Who's calling?
I'm calling on behalf of Councilman Mendez, it's for a job.
Has he been in Buenos Aires long?
A month, a little longer.
Do you know where I can find him?
Have you got an address?
This job is pretty urgent.
He's working on a construction site.
On a site?
Yes, he said it was...
Montevideo, near Lanoes...
I don't remember very well, but...
What type of job is it?
It's a job that will interest him.
It's for Councilman Mendez and...
Tell me something.
Yes...
Were he and Liliana Colotto friends?
They used to see each other.
She's from here. Why?
She works for the councilman.
She's the one who recommended him for the job.
She did, did she?
He'll be glad to hear that.
Really? Do you think he'll remember her?
Oh, yes! He really liked that girl.
But then she moved away...
To Buenos Aires, and they never saw each other again, I think.
Hello... Hello?
Hello! If he's here, it's a miracle.
Schmuck.
Poor guy. Imagine losing the love of your life.
Not him, you.
If you'd kept your mouth shut and called me first without saying anything.
Morning, we're looking for Isidoro Gómez.
What is it?
Who are you?
Mike Hammer, asshole. Did he come to work?
No he didn't. We know nothing about him.
Give me his address.
Right away.
Fernandez! Fernandez!
We know Gomez got a phone calilast night.
He went in the bedroom and came out 10 minutes later with his coat and suitcase packed.
The foreman says they owed him a week's pay but that he left without any fuss.
I can ask around if you want, Inspector.
I saw the same photographs you did.
I should have picked him out.
Forget it, Esposito. That case is nothing but hot air.
If you think I'll do all that paperwork to issue a request in Chivilcoy to search some old lady's house to find letters the son may or may not have sent and yadda, yadda, yadda...
Please, Esposito. You're nuts.
We have nowhere else to look, sir.
Your little game of Don Quixote with Romano was enough.
Poor guy got transferred to bumfuck, Iowa.
Or maybe he's in Chivilcoy,try asking him.
Anyway... the general saidwhat he had to.
Oh well...
I don't know what to do.
Morales is getting worse every day, the murderer knows we're after him, my judge is a moron, I want to kill Irene, and the only guy I can trust in this world is a drunk, a total fucking imbecile.
I have an advantage. A small one, but an advantage.
Today's the 28th, right?
The drunk idiot hasn't got paid yet.
Last month's he already drank.
So when it's time to pay the bill, he'll have a dilemma.
Either he says he's broke, gets arrested, beat up, goes home a mess and his wife kicks him out for good, or he turns to his boss the chump, who happens to be me, and asks him to pay.
But one thing.
Since his boss is a chump, but not a complete chump, he'll pay one last time.
But in exchange for a favor.
And the drunk idiot can't say no.
Isn't that right?
I gotta pee.
Hold on. The old lady has to come out at some point.
Too much Napoleon Solo and Perry Mason. That's your problem.
I'm serious, I gotta take a leak.
Son of a bitch!Damn you!
Damn you!
You scared the fucking crapout of me!
I scared you?What are you doing here?
I came to help you.
You're supposed to keep watch outside. If she comes back, we're screwed.
She ain't coming back.
How do you know?
She's in the grocery store, she'll be a while.
Calm down, for God's sake.
Did you find anything?
The letters...
Huh?
The letters, but no... Come here...
There's no address.
This one's from the other day.
So?
It's recent!
The trash. The envelopes may still be in the trash.
So! No, nothing here!
Nothing at all?
Nothing.
Did you go through it?
Wanna try?
Knock it off!
Go on!... What is it? Come here!
Calm down, I'll let you out.
Easy! Want me to drive?
The dog probably had rabies, you're gonna die.
Why didn't you keep watch?
If she finds out we broke in...
Benjamin, as soon aswe came for the letters, sooner or later she'd realize.
That's why we didn't take the letters.
You weren't stupid enough to bring them, were you?
Ah... And what if I did?
What if?
What if?
If she finds out, she'll tell Gomez and the guy will disappear for good.
Don't you see?
No.
You don't?
You're fucking blind!
Because you...
You'll see, when I figure it out... The whole thing about the date...
I'd much rather work alone!
Tactical Revolutionary Command, may I help you?
Wrong number. That's quite all right.
Nothing at all?
Or I'm missing something.
It's like the guy knew we were going to read the letters.
It's just names.
Bullshit, nothing concrete.
"Don't worry about me.
I'm like Manfredini, not Bavastro.
"People from Chivilcoy.
Here, let me see. Oh, shit...
Sperm Bank, loan department. Good morning... We borrow sperm.
Deposit or withdrawal?
Esposito!, Sandoval!
Wrong number... Sandoval!
Judge Fortuna wants to see you.
You hear my voice when I speak to you, don't you, Esposito?
Yes, sir.
Then I have to assume that if I tell you something and you do exactly the opposite, it's not that you didn't hear me but that you could give a flying fuck about the order I gave you.
Isn't that right, Esposito?
Not quite like that, sir.
And if my colleague from Chivilcoy calls me very angry to tell me that two of my employees broke into some poor old lady's house, that means what I say isn't worth a bucket of shit.
I don't know where your colleague could have heard such a thing.
That's exactly what I told him,Esposito.
However, my colleague tells me that the other day in Chivilcoy at the intersection of Franciso Savey and the corner of Schiaffino in the city limits of Chivilcoy a black Peugeot was parked with a Buenos Aires license plate number 133-809, and my colleague asks the Federal Police to run a background check on the vehicle.
Guess whose name the car is registered to?
Tell me, who?
A certain...
Espo...
Esposi!
To.
And the Federal Police tell him where he works.
And the judge calls me to see if I can clear things up.
And the truth is, Esposito, I can't.
Because I don't look like a judge anymore, I look like a first class fucking idiot.
Because I say I want A and I people give me Z.
Just like this piece of shit typewriter they gave me!
Excuse me, sir, but...
I think something weirdis going on here.
Exactly. Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
You ain't heard nothing yet.
After you can go right back to treating me like a fucking idiot.
But listen to this.
Because what stood out most in that little town wasn't the two guysfrom Buenos Aires, no.
Or that one of them was seen tying his shoelaces when he was wearing loafers.
What stood out most was that one of them walked into the grocery store, greeted them pleasantly, asked for a bottle of whisky and left drinking straight from the bottle.
Shall I describe him for you?
We have to deny it, Benjamin. "It wasn't me, I don't know..."
Don't ever talk to me again.
Never again.
Deny everything.
Ma'am, honestly...
Get out of my sight.
Are you against us too?
Irene, I'm talking to you!
Irene!
Not only was it a stupid move, but you did it behind my back.
I didn't think you'd be...
You think I'm here to joke around.
I didn't say that. You didn't need to. I can tell.
Let's get this straight.
I'm the boss and you're the employee.
Twelve letters. 31 pages on thin paper.
He mentions 5 jobs,two as a builder, one delivering groceries, two without details.
Three neighborhoods in Buenos Aires: Monte Grande, San Justo and Avellaneda.
Six names: Anido, Mesias, Oleniak, Manfredini,
Bavastro y Sanchez.
Only one reference to a woman:
Rosa, apparently an aunt.
That's it. That's all I've got The rest is nothing.
Benjamin!
This is nothing too?
Please...
Leave it open, it isn't private.
I talked to Fortuna.
I explained that you're an imbecile.
I used my irresistible smile and convinced him to call the judge in Chivilcoy and forget the whole thing.
I don't know how to thank you.
I ask that you refrain from such actions in the future.
You're free to go.
One question, if I may.
Which irresistible smile? I don't think I've seen it.
Of course not. I save it for my boyfriend, as I should.
Of course.
Right. I won't take any more of your time.
And bring me the Liliana Colotto file, to seal it and archive it.
The case is closed.
Getting engaged. Kids today laugh at it.
Who gets engaged anymore?
And this kid? What was his name? He was here less than a year...
Godoy. Godoy!
- Larreta got him the job.
- That's right. Yes... Silly me, I didn't put a date on the photo.
When was it?
Two or three months after Chivilcoy.
A week later. I remember perfectly.
A week after we fought you showed up with Alfonso whatever his name was to announce your engagement.
Look at Sandoval, trying to look sober.
It's so weird, I don't recognize myself.
I look like someone else.
Who were you? What were you like?
I don't know. Straight, conservative...
Stuck-up.
Structured.
Inflexible.
Young.
Young, Benjamin. I was young.
You were young, too.
Look, no gray hair.
And here, looking to the side, all serious.
I was another person.
Your novel might be really good.
But it's not for me.
You've reached the end of your life and you want to look back.
But I can't.
I have to go to work every day.
And live with this.
It may not be "The" Justice, but it's "some" justice.
And at the end of the day I have to go home and live with my husband... and with my children, who I adore.
My whole life I've looked forward.
"Backwards" is out of my jurisdiction.
I declare myself incompetent.
What a case, Jesus Christ.
It never dies.
Morales! Morales!
Hello!
How are you?
- How are you?
- Espósito
Of course. How are you? Fine, and you?
Here I am.
Would you like to sit?
Yes... How are things?
This month I'm here Tuesdays and Thursdays.
What?
In this station.
The other days of the week I wait in the other stations.
I change it every month.
He'll have to come through eventually.
He must live out of town, he knows in the city he'd be caught.
It's been a year but I imagine you haven't stopped investigating. - Right?
- No, no...
You must think I'm crazy.
No.
Don't worry about me, please. No, I won't.
The worst part is I'm starting to forget.
I have to constantly make myself remember her. Every day.
The day she was killed, Liliana made me tea with lemon.
I'd been coughing all night and she said it would help.
I remember those stupid things.
Then I start having doubts and I don't remember if it was lemon or honey in the tea.
And I don't know if it's a memory or a memory of a memory I'm left with.
Excuse me.
I need to talk to you. Come in.
Thank you.
Something happened to me yesterday.
I was up all night thinking about it.
I thought about you...
Have you ever... have you ever seen things from a different angle?
You see someone else and what the other person is going through helps you see your own life.
Go on.
Yes.
And I thought, "I have to talk to Irene."
You might get pissed at me...
Sorry.
You might want to kill me, but... I have to give it a try.
Wait a moment while I close the door.
Sandoval, I'm busy. I'll call you when I'm done.
Benjamin asked me to come.
Yes, I was hoping the three of us could talk.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I ran into Morales yesterday at the train station...
Doing what?
My crystal ball is broken.
He goes to the terminals every day looking for the killer.
Every single day after working at the bank.
You can't imagine his love.
It's touching.
It's as if his wife's death just left him there, stopped, stuck in time forever.
You should see his eyes.
They're in a state of pure love.
Can you imagine a love like that?
Unaffected by the wear and tear of the routine?
Speak for yourself, it doesn't affect mine.
We think the guy deserves another chance, ma'am.
Where do I come in?
The case is closed. We'd have to reopen it.
You're asking me to destroy an official document, with mine and the judge's signature on it... and to falsify statements and dates so it will look like the case is still open?
That's a brilliant idea. We hadn't...
Don't fuck with me.
Everything okay, sir?
Tell me. Decime... Did you see a stack of letters on my desk?
No.
Sandoval?
He left down Talcahuano.
Not only do you sneak off to get drunk, you also steal evidence.
Everything's under control. If Irene reads the file...
Hands off. Are you nuts?
We're going back.
Sit down for a second. Sit down and take it easy.
Know why we can't find him, Benjamin?
Because we're stupid.
Look:
"Twelve letters.
31 pages. Five jobs..." I already read this part.
Can we go?
Hold on a second. My mind exploded, I couldn't stop.
I kept asking myself, "Why can't we find this guy?"
He always vanishes. Where is he?
And I started thinking about guys.
Guys in general. Not just this guy, but...
Guys in general.
"The" guy.
The guy can do anything to be different.
But there's one thing he can't change. Not him, not you, not anybody.
Take me, for example.
I'm young, I have a good job, a wife who loves me...
And like you always say,
I keep throwing my life away in dives like this.
Many times you've asked, "Why are you here, Pablo?"
"Why?"
You know why, Benjamin?
Because it's my passion.
I love coming here, getting drunk, slugging it out with anyone who pisses me off...
I love it.
Just like you, Benjamin.
There's nothing you can do to get Irene out of your head.
She's dying to marry someone else, her desk drawer is full of wedding dress magazines.
She got engaged, had a party, everything.
But you keep waiting for the miracle, Benjamin.
Why?
Come here.
How's it going, notary?
How are you?
How are you?
This is that friend I mentioned, Esposito.
Andretta the notary. A real notary, and my tech advisor.
Here's my card.
Let's begin with the first letter from our friend Gomez.
It's okay, keep it.
"I swear it rained so hard I looked worse than Oleniak that night."
Notary, please.
Juan Carlos Oleniak. First played for Racing Academy in '60.
In '62 he went to Argentinos Juniors, and back to Racing in '63.
In a classic match with San Lorenzo, he got pushed and fell face-first into the ditch.
He was soaked.
We call him Plato. The Academy is his life.
"I'll send for you.
We make a great team.
Anido by himself isn't the same as Anido with Mesias."
Anido and Mesias, backs on the club that won it all in '61. Negri at goalie,
Anido and Mesias. Blanco, Peano and Sacchi. Corbatta, Pizzuti, Mansilla,
Sosa and Belén.
"Don't worry about me.
I'm like Manfredini, not Bavastro." Notary?
Pedro Waldemar Manfredini.
Racing paid peanuts for him and he ended up being an extraordinary player.
Incredible.
Julio Bavastro, right forward.
Played only two matches between '62 and '63 without scoring.
Quote: "I don't want to end up like Sanchez." Who's he talking about?
He can only mean the goalie, Ataulfo Sanchez.
Eternal benchwarmer.
He played only 17 matches between '57 and '61.
Notary, what is Racing to you?
A passion.
Even after 9 years without a championship?
A passion is a passion.
You see, Benjamin?
A guy can change anything.
His face, his home, his family, his girlfriend, his religion, his God.
But there's one thing he can't change.
He can't change his passion.
It's a beautiful night for soccer.
HuracÃ¡n hosts Avellaneda's Racing Club at Tomas Duco Stadium on a splendid night for soccer.
Racing has slipped in the standings and can't waste this final opportunity to stay in the race for the championship.
Jorge has the ball. He blows by Brindisi.
Great move. He heads down the left sideline.
He shakes Houseman perfectly. Centers deep to Nestor Escola.
Over to Roberto Diaz. Diaz kicks with his left...
He hits the bar! Incredible! HuracÃ¡n gets away with one!
Espectacular, el pÃºblico de Racing gritaba el gol...
Academy! Academy! Academy!
This is madness.
It's chaos.
You just don't know soccer.
You have to be a little more patient.
There's too many people. It's impossible.
Impossible!
There he is!
Where?
- Over there! - Where? I don't see him.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Come on Benja... Come on...
Sorry, sorry!
Isidoro Gómez.
Come on, let's go.
What's up, Benjamin?
I'm sick of this. It's been a month.
We've been to 4 matches!
I said to be patient.
Gómez?
Goal!
Racing Club scored!
Damn it...
Gomez!
Come back here! Come here!
Benjamin hurry up!
I had him! He ran away!
Where's Baez?
Baez!
He ran off, did you see him?
What's he look like?
I gave you the photo!
I mean how tall is he?
Medium-height, skinny... What are they doing?
He's getting away!
I can't take it, Benjamin. What's he look like, he asks!
Son of a bitch!
He should have been there, not us!
He doesn't know him, we do!
Why didn't you give him the photo? I did!
Go to hell, you motherfucker!
Can't I take a crap in peace?
Come out! Fuck off! It's occupied!
Come on out, the cops are here. Nothing will happen to you.
What police? Quit fucking around.
Pablo!
Police, stop!
Stay there, don't jump!
Where is he going?
Sorry.
How's it going?
I'm waiting for Sandoval. What for?
I play the nice guy, then he comes in...
I'll explain later, it's a routine we have.
Oldest trick in the book.
You can't question him without the judge.
Of course we do!
Actually, we have to pull it off before he gets here.
Questioning a prisoner with no lawyer or judge?
Ordoóñez! You seen Sandoval?
He left a while ago.
Damn it!
It won't stand up. What will you charge him with?
What do you mean? You think it's little to go on?
Looking at the victim in a photo?
Yes, it is.
That's why we have to soften him up.
What if it's not him? Don't look at me like that.
Eduardo!
- What if it's not him? - Of course it is.
Yes, Counselor? Don't call me that. Go get Sandoval.
Should I take a taxi? Yes. iNo! No, no...
He goes to Robertino's in the morning. in Viamonte, hurry!
No. Wait, Eduardo.
Wait, wait! What are you doing?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
It's him.
How do you know?
I don't know.
- See?
- I don't know how I know, but I know.
How?
Gomez, Isidoro Néstor.
I.D. Number.
10,740,925.
- Marital status?
Address.
MocoretÃ¡2428, Isidro Casanova.
What train do you take into town?
What train do you take into town?
I don't take the train. I take the bus.
What's the problem?
Mo, core... ah,...
This typewriter is no good!
The "A" doesn't work.
Wait, hold on.
What is this about?
Please, I beg you.
You're implicated in the Liliana Colotto case, rape and homicide.
It happened on June 21st, 1974. Actually, you're the accused.
I'm going to take your statement.
You'll be assigned a public defender.
Wait, wait.
Liliana Colotto?
I knew her back in Chivilcoy.
What happened to her?
Tell me, Gómez,
Why do you think you've spent 3 days behind bars?
I have no idea. I was at the match...
Yeah, and you took off running.
What would you do? Two crazy-looking guys suddenly jump you... What happened to Liliana?
Look, Gomez, don't...
You know as well as I do you raped and killed her.
Liliana... Are you serious? I would never do that.
I haven't set foot in Chivilcoy in over a year, I can prove it.
We looked for you a week after the homicide and you disappeared, from a hostal and a job.
What hostal? I never left any hostal.
Gomez, don't play dumb. The hostal on Piedras.
That was a year ago!
I left because I couldn't afford it.
And your job?
I found one that paid better.
What's that got to do with Liliana?
I've known her my whole life, she's a friend from my childhood.
They can't find Sandoval. What?
They can't find Sandoval.
Okay, let me think...
Listen. Fortuna should be here any minute.
Please, wait for him...
Please... Huh, yeah...
You could...
Maybe... You could be right.
It might be preferable, more practical...
Let me see, one second.
Look, Gomez.
The judge handling your case will be here soon, so we'll wait.
Ma'am?
Sorry to interrupt, deputy, I mean, Counselor.
I know you're handling this case.
But this kid couldn't have done it.
We'll talk outside.
Wait, just a minute. Look at him.
This kid couldn't have done it.
Let me see the autopsy.
The Colotto girl... Here she is. 5 feet 6, 128 pounds.
Look what he did to her.
I'm sorry, Gomez. But I don't buy it.
The Amazon and the Pigmy?
Besides, she was a beautiful woman.
Please, look at this face.
A beauty like her isn't within just anyone's reach.
It takes a real man to hook a woman like that.
You think so? I mean...
The door wasn't forced.
That means she knew her assailant.
Yes.
But there's no way such a woman would ever remember this twinkie!
Unless she was a hooker.
Some guys you only do for money.
Who is she?
Keep your fucking mouth shut.
No, she was a decent girl, I assure you.
I agree with the kid about that.
She was two-timing that bank clerk for sure.
I'll bet his horns were so big he needed a convertible.
What are you laughing at, retard?
That guy who gave testimony last time.
Sandoval?
Right. I bet it was him. He was her lover.
Tall, good-looking, broad shoulders.
A man truly capable of warming up a woman.
Look at this pussy.
I'll bet when she saw him she thought,
"Oh, no, it's that schmuck who always makes mushy faces in all the photos."
Isn't that right?
Yes or no?
That's how I wanted you motherfucker!
Get him out of here!
I caught you motherfucker!
Get him out, please!
You people are crazy.
Listen, Benjamin.
"The damage to the right parietal bone demonstrates the assailant had extraordinary upper body strength."
Look, two noodles.
"Likewise, due to the depth of her vaginal injuries, we may deduce that the assailant was very well-endowed."
Obviously they're not talking about this microbe.
He must have a peanut.
There it is, bitch. How do you like it?
Sweetheart, you'll never reach the pióñata. First, you're too short.
Second, you're not man enough for a real woman like me.
Not man enough? Fucking bitch! I fucked the shit out of her!
I fucked the shit out of her!
I fucked her brains out!
Stop, stop, let him go...
Let him go, Benjamin!
Let go of me!
Touch her and I'll kill you. I'll kill you!
Are you Espósito?
Are you Espósito or are you Espósito?
Hello?
It's me, did I wake you?
No, no...
I was working a bit.
Why are you up so late?
I was thinking...
You don't say.
Yeah, silly. No, about the novel.
I want to read it when it's finished.
Great, I'd love that!
Sure you don't want to talk a little while?
No, I'll drink my tea and see if I can get back to sleep.
Okay.
Bye.
This morning, at the presidential residence in Olivos, the president,
Doóña Maria Estela Martinez de Perón...
Irene, Irene!
The dressmaker is here!
Look, she made the cape like you wanted!
Come on and try it on.
I'll be right in.
Imunicipalities and public facilities located across the country.
She personally delivered clothing, school supplies and candy to be distributed in Lobos, a village in the province of Buenos Aires.
Hello?
Morales, how are you? It's been ages, what a surprise!
Yeah, I'm watching it, but I turned it down.
What? And also, thanks to them, we can achieve many things, because people can't do it all on their own.
They help a lot to get everything done.
Good morning.
Miss Menendez Hastings, from Court 42.
We're here to see Mr. Romano.
He's very busy.
What's it about?
Sir! Sir!
You can't go in there!
I'll leave my credentials, don't worry.
These two, raising their hands.
I want you to get them.
Just go and find them.
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?
No, you are.
Ma'am!
We need to talk to you.
Fellas, would you mind? If you'd called first, I'd have had coffee ready.
Isidoro Gómez. Rape and murder, arrested by the court.
Penitentiaries informed us he's been freed by Executive Order.
We checked, and here we are.
Anything to say? Yeah, sure. That you two need to get out more.
Justice is nothing but an island.
This is the real world.
While you two are shooting birds, we're in here, fighting in the middle of the jungle.
Gómez, Gómez, Gómez...
Yes...
He started working with us when he was in jail.
He'd give us information, spy on young guerrillas...
He did good work! We like him. What's the problem?
Don't you agree?
Do you realize what you're saying?
He's confessed, He's a convicted murderer.
Perhaps, but he's also intelligent and brave.
He can break into a home and get the job done.
His personal life is his own business, right?
With all the subversives out there...
Who cares?
If we only used good guys...
He was arrested under Judge Fortuna's jurisdiction, and we want-
Do you think I don't know you let him go to get back at me?
You think I'm stupid?
That's two questions.
Which one shall I answer first?
Is that true?
Ma'am...
Would you do me a favour?
What are you gonna do, file an appeal?
No offense, but there's nothing you can do.
Except go back to your office, take a seat, and watch and learn.
They don't teach the new Argentina at Harvard.
And why do you come with her?
You think it gives you immunity?
Leave her alone, she's out of your league.
She studied law, you barely finished high school.
She's young, you're old.
She's rich, you're poor.
She's Menendez Hastings and you're Esposito, a zero.
She's untouchable, you aren't.
Let her go back to her world.
But if you have a problem with me, come alone and we'll settle it.
Come on, Irene.
Let's go.
You do have one thing in common.
Neither of you can do a thing about it.
You said life.
Yes, he should get life.
Well, then?
These people don't give a shit about justice.
And where he is now, we can't get anywhere near him.
If I could, what for?
What would I do?
What would four bullets get me?
A lifetime in jail.
Gomez goes free without ever serving and I spend 50 years stuck in a cell, envying him...
No.
No, life in prison would have been fair.
I wish I could help, but I honestly don't know how.
Who knows? Some other time...
Anyway!
I'll get it.
No, please. It's just a coffee.
I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me.
I wouldn't have made it this far without you.
I owe you one.
Counselor, sir.
It's about the Igarzabal file, sir.
Stop calling me Counselor, would you already?
If you do it in front of the judge I'll get in trouble.
What about the file?
Have you made a copy?
I'm on it.
You'd have to be there, but you're here!
Come on!
Benjamin...
Yes?
How long before you talk to me again?
I talk to you every day.
I'm not untouchable.
Or from another world.
If only you were... Irene, let's drop it.
Drop what?
You're marrying the engineer, zapiola Menendez Urtubiea and so on.
You're not jealous...
For God's sake. I hope you live happily ever after.
Any objections?
No, none.
Go on, object.
Irene, please...
What are you looking at?
What do you want? Go away!
Where can we meet?
What for?
So you can present your objections about my life, my fiancé, my marriage and anything else related to the case.
We coulf meet for coffee after work.
Time. Eight thirty.
Place? Los Inmortales.
La Richmond.
Sorry, my suggestion wasn't very elegant.
No, Benjamin. Somewhere far away from here.
Who are you spying on?
Sorry. Phone call for you, sir.
From a bar?
Pablo Sandoval. You cocksucking bastard.
Wash your fucking mouth!
No, Benjamin... I can't believe they called you.
Damn it!
I told everyone...
"Don't bother my friend, this is a man's job!"
You're not a man, you stinking drunk.
What? Me, drunk?
Fuck you!
Fascist! Fascist!
He's a Nazi!
Listen, officer.
We're from Court 42, I'll handle it.
Don't worry.
Come with me. Arrest the motherfuckers!
Show them some fucking justice!
Come here! My jacket, my jacket!  You're wearing it.
What time does your wife get home?
At eight.
How odd.
There's no answer...
My mouth is dry... Have you got any...?
There's no answer!
Leave that alone!
She's never going to answer.
Why?
Because the phone doesn't work.
Put that down!
I told you a thousand times, Benjamin.
I wanted to sue their asses.
And you didn't help me.
That was six months ago!
The phone hasn't worked for a year!
Motherfuckers never fixed it!
Damn it!
You can't spend the night here.
Put that down!
Stop touching stuff.
If you ever called me, you'd know it doesn't work.
Leave that.
What are you looking for?
I wanted to sue them.
Look at me. You have a date?
No, no!
You have a date.
And I'm leaving... The last thing I need is you calling me a party pooper.
Damn it, too much furniture in here!
Sit here!
I always run into shit!
Have a seat until you feel better.
There...
Stay there until you feel better.
What time is it?
I have a watch in the bedroom.
What bedroom, idiot?
This is my house.
Yes...
It's alright, we're okay.
Easy...
Come on Benja...
I'll go try to convince your wife not to kill you.
Call her on the phone.
You said it didn't work.
Mine doesn't work, Benjamin...
Use yours. Just stay here.
Don't touch anything, don't do anything.
I'll be right back.
Turn off the light.
We'll catch that son of a bitch!
We'll catch him...
We were working all day...
Save it for some other time.
Please, let me explain.
It's the last time!
Okay, okay.
Be patient with him, he needs help.
He needs help? No, I know...
What I mean is, if we help him, it's easier for everyone.
You want to get rid of him. Don't say that!
What's this?
What happened?
Hold on a second. Pablo!
What happened?
I don't know!
Pablo! Don't scare me!
Hold on!
Pablo!
Hey!...
Nooo!
What, what happened?!
Nooo...
What happened? No! No, no!
What happened?
What happened? This is madness.
It will be if that bastard finds you.
He's gonna go after you.
No, my father knows who to talk to.
He works for Romano, Romano won't mess with me.
Don't worry, I'll be fine!
But, Jujuy!
For God's sake, Irene!
My cousins are like feudal lords there.
Nobody will touch you.
Not Romano, not anyone.
What will I do in Jujuy?!
Same as here.
Sign and stamp...
They have your desk ready.
No, no, no no, no Irene, I can't! I can't.
I have my life here,
I have my old man! I have everything here.
What we can do here?
Us...
We can't do anything.
Bye.
It's a rough draft.
I'll make more.
Your house is exactly as I imagined it.
How did you imagine it?
Exactly like this. Exactly like I imagined it.
Sure, I imagined your house would be totally different.
You've seen my house?
No, I mean unlike this one.
Totally different.
What does this mean?
Huh?
This piece of paper says "I FEAR"
No! No no no no... It's just something I did...
A writing excercise, half asleep...
To inspire imagination... Neve rmind.
Okay, shoot.
It's a novel, it doesn't have to be true, or even believable.
Yes...
No, what? It isn't believable?
No, Benjamin.
That part when...
When the guy leaves for Jujuy...
What's the problem?
Crying like he's all broken up...
So what? Her running on the platform after the man of her dreams...
Well... Touching hands through the glass,  like they're one.
And her crying, as if she knew her fate was mediocrity and never loving anyone, practically falling on the tracks, proclaiming love she'd never had the courage to confess...
That's what happened, isn't it?
If that's what happened, why didn't you take me with you?
Dimwit.
How does the case proceed?
I don't know.
I can say he spent 10 years counting llamas in the Andes.
And when I came back you were D.A., married and with two kids.
Should I put that?
Or that he came back married to a Jujuyan princess, pretty, rich...
She was wonderful.
It wasn't her fault I could never love her.
It's a lousy ending. It's crap.
You see?
I don't want to miss another chance.
How can I do nothing about it?
I've been asking myself for 25 years and I've only been able to come up with one answer.
"Forget it, it was another lifetime. It's over, don't ask."
It wasn't another lifetime.
It was this one.
It IS ths one.
I want to understand. How can someone live an empty life?
How do you live a life full of nothing?
How do you do it?
This is a waste of time.
We'll never find him!
Trust me, remember how formal he was?
Nobody notifies a change of address. Mine's from when I danced the pata-pata.
Gómez, Isidoro. Espora 691, Chivilcoy.
You see, that's his mother.
Sir, we are required by law to notify a change of address.
It's not something we do because we feel like it.
Understand?
I do now.
Morales, Ricardo. There's one, two... Four, ma'am.
Let's search by I.D. number.
What's your first number?
Three, what's yours?
What do you care?
I can't...?
Here's a 5 and a 6.
Morales, Ricardo Augustin.
He changed addresses in 1975.
Write this down, pata-pata.
Who are you looking for?
Morales. How are you?
Remember me?
Esposito.
From the courts... 25 years ago.
Quite a surprise. I know, sorry.
How are you?
Everything okay? Such a long time.
What a surprise! Yeah...
Come in, please.
Shall I make coffee?
Coffee?
You're not drinking mate out here?
Out here?
I'm in the bank all day long.
You're still at the bank? I'll take that coffee.
You moved out here right after.
Yes. I wanted to start over, from scratch.
That's the good thing about the bank.
They have branches everywhere.
There's always a branch nobody wants, so here I am, with a promotion and everything.
How about that...
Remember Liliana?
Yes, of course.
How are you doing?
Still here.
No, I mean single, married...
No! No, really...
I think I just...
At that point, just closed shop.
I tried, but you know what?
It's complicated.
I got married.
You don't say. Yeah, for a while, but it didn't work.
I don't know if it was me...
It's complicated. It's complicated.
Quite a story, I can't believe it.
Never thought I had a novel in me.
You should flesh it out. It's like a long memo.
Crazy.
I could never forget it.
A mistake.
You should put it behind you, trust me.
You came here because of Gomez, right?
What do you mean?
He was on the loose, he might come looking for you.
No, no.
I'm not scared of Gomez.
Maybe he's dead. Maybe.
They came looking for me. Yes, I know.
How do you know? I just read it.
They found your friend.
Yes, poor Sandoval.
Do you remember Sandoval?
No...
My coworker at the courts.
They came looking for me, didn't find me and let him have it.
Bastards!
Gómez was never found, right?
Guess.
Those guys always get away with it.
You know, there's something I need to ask you.
How did you learn to live without Liliana?
It was 25 years ago, Esposito.
I was sure you wouldn't be able to. It was 25 years ago, Esposito.
Especially with him on the loose. How did you start over?
It was 25 years ago!
Forget it.
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have made it this far.
You owe me one.
I don't know what you want me to say!
You didn't care the guy got a free ride!?
There was nothing I could do.
- No?
- No! - No!?
- NO!
You spent a year looking for the guy, they let him go and you do nothing?
I wasted a year looking for him on train stations, and they let him go!
What can I do?
That's it?
Yes!
The rest of your life behind a desk? Look who's talking.
You're better than I am.
What do you care?
It's my life, not yours.
No, Morales, it's my life too!
Your love for that woman... I never saw it again!
In anybody!
Nobody! Ever!
Get out of my house!
Right now, please!
It's my life, not yours.
I'm sorry, I'm getting old, that's it.
That might be it...
I couldn't stop thinking about it! Go dwell on it at home!
Gómez didn't kill Sandoval.
So?
Gómez knew us both!
If he'd been there, he'd have waited for me.
There's something...
I had a couple of photos at home, of myself.
When Sandoval got killed, the photos had been turned over.
Nothing else had been touched.
I thought...
I think...
Are you Espósito?
Huh?
Did you hear what I said, asshole? Are you Esposito?
What's going on? What are you doing?
Huh?
Answer me!
Where are you going!?
Stop it, dude...
Where are you going?
Here...
What are you going to do?
I'm going to put on a record. It's okay.
You're going to put on a record?
Listen to me, are you Espósito or not?
Yes, I am.
I'm so ashamed I can't even bring myself to put flowers on his grave.
Maybe that's not what happened.
Maybe he fell asleep and they killed him without him even realizing, somebody knocked over the photos by accident, bumped into them...
I don't know what to think anymore.
Choose carefully.
Memories are all we end up with.
At least pick the nice ones.
But there's one thing I know I'll never forget.
The last thing Pablo said to me the night they killed him.
"Don't worry, Benjamin. We'll catch that son of a bitch."
And I will.
If he's alive, I will.
Well...
Wait, come in...
Sit down.
You can stop looking.
I couldn't go to the authorities. I knew the guy was untouchable.
But I also knew sooner or later he'd come looking for you.
Meet you there, at nine o'clock!
Hey, Gómez!
I got rid of the body and obviously he wasn't missed.
Was it worth it?
Forget about it! Forget it!
Who cares?
My wife is dead!
Your friend is dead!
Gomez is dead too!
They're all dead! Stop dwelling on it!
You'll start wondering if you could have stopped it...
You'll have a thousand pasts and no future!
Forget about it, trust me.
You'll end up with only memories.
I owed you one, right?
Now we're even.
Forget about it, forget it!
I couldn't stop thinking about it. /
What would four bullets get me?
It's my life, not yours.
Go dwell on it at home!
We'll catch him...
I've been wondering for 25 years.
Bye.
It wasn't another lifetime. /t was this one. /
A guy can do anything to be different.
What would four bullets get me?
But there's one thing he can't change. Not him, not you, not anybody.
How can someone live an empty life?
How do you live a life full of nothing?
How do you do it?
Please!
I fucked the shit out of her!
What retribution?
Please, please!
It's as if his wife's death just left him there, stuck in time forever.
My wife is dead! Your friend is dead!
Gómez is dead too! They're all dead!
They'd give him an injection and he'd take a nap.
Nobody, Benjamin.
Let him grow old.
Live a life full of nothing.
How did you start over?
That was 25 years ago!
25 years, Esposito! iForget about it!
Please.
Tell him...
Tell him at least to talk to me.
Please...
You said life.
"I FEAR"
"I LOVE YOU"
Is she in? Yeah, in her office?
You're alive!
Yeah...
I need to talk to you.
Shall I bring coffee, Ma'am? Go away.
It'll be complicated.
I don't care.
Shut the door.
THE SECRET OF THElR EYES
Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-ah Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie  Louie, Louie, you're gonna die
[AUDlENCE LAUGHlNG]
You know, I went to a doctor recently, he told me to eat slower.
And I was like, "Why eat slower?"
And he said, "Because your body gets full... ...but that message that your body's full... ...takes 20 minutes to travel from your stomach to your brain."
It takes 20 minutes before you know that you've already been full for 20 minutes.
First of all, what a douche bag your body is... ...that it takes 20 minutes.
What's taking 20 minutes to get--?
If I stub my toe, I know it immediately, and that's twice the distance.
What is this message doing that it's--?
It, like, stops at my tit:
"Hey, tit, what's up?"
"Hanging out, what you doing?"
"I'm going to tell them that we're full."
"Get up there, you idiot. We're gonna get huge if you don't tell him."
"Oh, well, excuse me." Then he goes off, "I'm not going yet," and goes down to my asshole.
He's like, "Hey, asshole, what are you doing?" My asshole's like:
That's how my asshole talks.
I-- I-- WOMAN: My God, you did not just say that.
[WOMAN LAUGHlNG] WOMAN:
No, I'm gonna go if you can. Seriously.  [CHUCKLES]
What?
Hi, could you stop talking?
You're making it hard for me to do my job.
Oh, okay, sorry.
It's okay, you don't have to be sorry, just don't do it anymore.
Okay.
Okay, thank you.
Anyway, holy shit.
Always just gets me a little-- Sorry.
I was on a plane the other day and people on the plane--
You know when you're on a plane on the tarmac and you can't get to the gate... ...because there's a plane at your gate?
WOMAN:
That happened to Mike the other day.
Excuse me?
No, my-- Well, my-- Ha, ha.
My friend, that happened to him too.
I don't care.
Well, no, my friend Mike-- Hey, nobody cares about your friend Mike.
Nobody cares about your friend Mike.
Okay.
Nobody cares about Mike.
Okay, whatever, it was funny. What was funny?
Unlike you. Ha, ha.
I'm sorry?
I said "unlike you."
It was funny, unlike me.
Yes. Yes, I did.
Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
What happened to the parade? What parade?
The parade of stupid **** you were a float in.
I'm just curious.
Okay, that's not even funny.
It's not? No.
Okay. You sure?
You're offensive.
I'm offensive? Yes.
What do you mean?
You're making jokes about rape, and that's offensive.
You don't like rape?
No.
You don't? No.
That's really weird, because, you know, you wouldn't even exist... ...if your mom hadn't raped that homeless Chinese guy.
Oh, my God.
However many years ago you were born.
No, listen, I'm sorry.
I'm really--
It's hard to come back from that. But I am sorry.
I don't-- I didn't--
I didn't mean that. Look, can you do me a favor?
What? Can you please just die of AlDS?
Does anybody have AlDS who--?
That could put their dick in her face and get her started on that?
Anybody? Oh, my God.
I could like-- I could sue you. What?
You can sue me? Yeah.
You know who I'd like to sue?
Everybody that works in the hospital that you were born at... ...because I would like to sue them... ...for not responsibly pulling your head off the second....
Letting you live was medical malpractice.
Can't you just, like, move on? No, I can't.
I really can't... ...because you're the worst thing that ever happened in America.
You're-- Seriously, it goes you, slavery... ...and then Pearl Harbor and 9/11 combined.
Those are the three.
And so, like, as an American... ...I feel like it's my duty to make you feel poorly.
And your mother's a whore.
My mother's dead.
Your mother's dead? Yeah.
That's good. It is. It is.
You know why?
Because she can't make any more **** with her ****.
You did not just call me a C word.
What's that?
Did you just call me a C word?
No, I called you a ****.
Because you're a **** and your mother is one and she had one.
The moment you were being born... ...there was a guy walking by, he said:
"Hey, look.
I'm glad you stunk.
Hey, man.
That woman was a nightmare in there. MAN 1:
The one who looked like the Fox News anchor?
She will not stop.
The whole night she's been yelling stuff? MAN 1:
She wasn't aggressive at first, but she's getting encouraged and it's building.
Yeah, but, you know-- Yeah.
I'm joking. That was totally uncalled for.
Actually, no, it wasn't. You were talking all night.
That's what happens. Well, I was participating.
I'm allowed to participate.
Then why were you the only one participating?
Just think about that for a second.
Why was it just you?
Because most people would never do that.
Most people are polite... ...and they'd rather cut off their hand than hurt a show by talking.
That's what-- A good person wouldn't do that.
So you must be a bad person.
No, I'm not.
Yeah, I think you are.
No, I'm a good person.
Why?
Why do you think you're a good person? I just am.
I know I'm a good person... ...and you have no right to talk to me like that.
Actually, I do. That's how that room works.
I have a right to talk.
I'm actually paid to talk in there and to say stuff and people laugh.
You're not supposed to say anything.
Oh, my God, get over yourself.
People come to shows and talk, that's what they do.
And it's your job to put up with it or learn how to deal with it at least.
I mean, why are you being such a baby?
Okay, look, let me ask you a question.
Do you like your life? Yes.
So?
No, I'm sure you do.
You're a student, you're happy, you have good days... ...and you have full and fun nights, right?
Yes.
I'm not a loser like you. Yeah, see, that's the whole point.
You have a good life and it's just the way you want it to be.
These guys, comedians, me, these guys don't have a life.
This is all they have.
Their days are shit.
They don't have many friends, they don't have families.
They have this.
The only good part of their lives is the 15 minutes that they get to be on-stage.
Maybe once a week, sometimes once a month.
And you took that 15 minutes, the one-- Just picture this.
The one 15 minutes that they would've had that they would have enjoyed... ...maybe for a long time, and you ruined it.
You took that away from them.
I know you think it's cute, but it's not.
It's really-- It's a rotten thing to do.
And I don't know how you can think you're a good person... ...if you do things like that.
Honestly, I think you should be ashamed of yourself. I really do.
You have no right to make me feel like that.
I did nothing tonight, and you were just gross and insulting.
You're just one of those unattractive people... ...who are totally bitter against people like me.
That's right. That's right.
You're right. That's what happened.
That's exactly what happened.
Thank you very much.
Good night. Good night.
[GROANS]
Man, you had a shot up till you did that last thing.
You think?
Yeah, you could have turned that around.
Shit. MAN 2:
She was about to feel bad. You could be going to get a drink with her now.
She'd probably pay for the drink too.
Hey, Laurie.
Hey, you here to see Simon?
Yeah, he asked me to come.
Okay, he's finishing up a conference call.
Do you wanna sit for a minute? Sure.
You know, we never see you here.
Oh, yeah, well, I don't go out for the acting much anymore.
Oh, how come?
I don't know, I'm not a good actor.
Oh, don't say that.
No, it's okay, I'm just not good at it.
That's really neg.
What?
It's really negative.
Oh, I didn't know because you only used the first three letters.
Yeah, I just think you have to go for it.
How do you know you're not the next Tom Cruise?
Because I just hate it, standing there in fake clothes and acting.
It just feels stupid.
Yeah, but if that's your dream-- See, it's not my dream though, Laurie.
To be an actor, the odds are so low that--
It's like saying, "I'm gonna be a cartoon dog with a jetpack."
That's what I'm gonna do.
I mean, that has just gotta be the dumbest... ...most irresponsible, stupid, stupid thing to wanna be an actor.
I'm trying to be an actor. [PHONE RlNGS]
Yes, he's here.
Listen, I, uh--
I didn't-- I meant that, um....
You know, I just meant good luck, you know?
Hi, hi, hi.
Hey, Simon.
For crying out loud, how are you?
I'm okay. Hi. Hey.
Long time no see.
I know, I just haven't been around.
Listen, sit down, because I got incredible news.
Yeah? Louie.
Louie.
Hey, Simon. I got you a part in The Godfather.
You mean another sequel?
No, no, no.
Somebody bought the rights again and they're making another Godfather... ...but it's set two years into the future and it's all Jews.
Oh, my God.
I know, and I got you a part in it.
I got you a part. Heh, heh.
Listen, Simon-- Yeah, yeah, I know you.
No auditions, no acting.
But this, you don't even have to read for it.
You know what happened?
Matthew Broderick, who is starring and directing in this... ...he saw you on television.
And he personally called and wanted you to have this part.
You play a cop, you're in about five scenes... ...and they're all about your character.
It's huge.
Listen, Simon, I appreciate-- You're not saying no to this.
Well-- You're not.
This is not a no.
I told them you're doing it.
I said yes!
Well, you may have to call them back. No.
You call them back. You're doing it.
Simon-- You're doing it!
Listen, Simon-- You're doing it!
Simon, look, I--
I came to you because I'm a comedian. Everybody tells you if you're on-stage, you should also try to be in movies.
And, you know, I appreciate everything you've done for me.
You've been great, and you got me that Martin Lawrence movie.
[GRUNTlNG]
Simon?
Simon? Simon?
Oh, Louie.
Hey, Joan, I'm sorry.
He loved you.
You were his favorite client.
[CRYlNG]
Hey, Laurie.
Are you gonna take that part in The Godfather?
I don't know. He was so happy he got that for you.
You should do it.
For him. Okay.
So, Matthew, this is Louie C. K.
Oh, hi, hi. Nice to meet you.
How you doing? Good.
Thank you for-- Oh, yeah, yeah.
I saw you on one of those late-night shows.
You're really funny.
Thanks. Thank you.
This isn't funny, but I had an idea that you'd be good at it.
Thank you.
You excited?
It's great.
Am I--? Can I just ask you a question?
Am I one of the--? Am I one of the Jews?
What? Am I--?
Am I one of the--? I'll see you out there.
Okay.
You-- You can't go in there.
Where's my father?
Is that seriously how you're gonna say it?
What?
Uh-- MAN: Cut it.
Sorry. No, well, look. Look, you're telling me that my father is dead.
Well, how do you tell somebody something like that?
Pretend my father's dead. Your fa--?
Your father or the character's father?
Is your father dead?
Let's try again. Okay, I'm really sorry.
It's okay, don't say you're sorry.
Okay, okay. It's okay.
Okay, let's go again. We'll go again.
You can't go in there.
Where's my father?
What the hell is that? What?
That face.
I didn't-- Cut.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, cut.
It's okay.
I thought it was the way I said "your father's dead."
Okay.
You can't go in there.
Where's my father?
Oh, your father's dead.
Oh, cut.
I'm sorry, what did--?
That wasn't good either?
You can't go in.
Where's my father? He's dead.
Well-- Uh-- Oh. Oh.
I forgot to say it was your father.
Yeah. You don't know who I'm talking about.
Okay, I'll do it again.
You can't go in there. Where's my father?
Your father's dead.
Where's my father?
Your father is dead.
That wasn't good, right?
I have to imagine your father's dead?
Yeah, right, you're telling somebody his father's dead.
That's why you say, "Your father's dead." Your father's dead.
I don't know anybody whose father died that I was to tell them.
I never did that before.
You can't go in there.
Where's my father?
Do you--?
Do you take the train here or--? Uh....
We'll go again.
Okay. Are you--?  No, I think-- We'll go again.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, I'm really sorry about how it's going.
That's okay.
So, what is it, are you nervous?
Not really.
What then?
I just don't like acting.
I'm not good at it and I don't like it.
Look, uh....
Look, maybe you don't like acting, that's not my business.
But try and respect other people's work.
We're gonna move on and we'll come back and shoot your scene.
Why don't you take a walk and try to find it in yourself to give a shit?
You just can't charge whatever you want for things.
Last week, this can of soup was a dollar-thirty, now you're asking $2.
What, do you make it up as you go along?
Hey, do you have cakey, doughnuty treat things?
Yeah, in the back. Thank you.
This is supposed to be a business with set prices.
You know what? I think I'm gonna have dinner out.
Forget that.
I don't want that soup anyway, it's too expensive. And, oh, I would like a plastic bag because I have a lot of garbage.
[CAT MEOWlNG] What's the matter, pal?
WOMAN: You mind? Give me a plastic bag.
I don't understand. Please explain it to me.
Why would you charge a fat man more money than you would pretty girls? [BAAlNG]  [MOOlNG]
[MAKES FARTlNG NOlSE] [CLUCKlNG]
WOMAN:
I'm gonna do all my business elsewhere. I'm going to the big supermarket.
You know, you can phone them. They deliver.
Of course you have to buy a lot.
So pack it all up.
Give me a lot of plastic bags.
I use them for garbage and all that sort of--
Don't move, man.
Give us the cash. Give us the cash.
Help.
Oh, shit.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, shit.
They don't give you guys real guns?
Yo, yo, shoot that bitch.
Hurry up, man, shoot him.
Mine ain't real either.
What?
It's my little brother's, man.
It's a toy. Why are you still pointing it? Why--?
Everybody knows it's fake. Put the gun away, man.
Oh, my God, you get out of here. BLACK THUG:
Shit.
Some help you were.
LOUlE:
Do it like this, when-- Just say it.
Instead of, like, exclaiming it, just say it.
Go ahead. Oh, my God.
That was great. Was that real?
Did you believe it?
Yeah, that was good.
Say it-- Say it-- Instead of at me, say it to yourself this time.
The same way, just declare, saying it.
Go ahead. Oh, my God.
That's pretty good. It's getting there.
It's getting there.
I have all night, so....
Yeah? Okay. You know what?
I'm really-- All right, you know what? I'm sorry. [LAUGHlNG]
Sometimes when I'm talking to my daughter... ...I'll be looking down at her, my little girl, and I just--
I see my mother, you know?
Your mother?
Yeah.
Is your mother there?
Is she...?
No, I just mean when I look at my daughter... ...that's what I see sometimes.
I see my mom.
Is she standing in front of her or is...?
Are you at your mother's house or...? [IAN LLOYD'S "BROTHER LOUlE" PLAYlNG]  Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie, you're gonna cry Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie  Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-ah
You doing a show tomorrow?
Yeah, I'm doing a short set at the Cellar.
I got this girl I'm dating, you mind if I bring her?
Fine.
What are you doing after?
I don't know. Why?
Maybe you could hang out with us after.
You're gonna be on a date?
[PANTlNG]
Come hang out with us after you're done. Why?
That's weird.
She wants to meet you.
All right.
After the show, I'll hang out for a few minutes, say hi, then you take her out.
But....
What's the deal?
Okay, this is kind of weird.
Yeah, it is.
Don't get all jaggedy on me.
Bro, I met this girl.
I really like her.
I mean, she's amazing and she gets me really, really horny.
I mean, she's beautiful.
I mean, this chick-- This woman.... Oh, my God.
Okay, so what?
We've been out like six times.
We always wind up back at her place making out, but--
I mean, really making out, tongues are everywhere.
I mean, she's grabbing on me.
She's grabbing on me-- This sounds great... ...but I don't wanna keep hearing about it.
Okay, so... ...we always do the same thing, just making out at her place.
And I get-- I mean, my dick is hard as a nail. It's swollen.
My dick is swollen and leaking--
This is the part I didn't want to hear, so stop. Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, here's the thing.
She really wants me.
But only with another guy.
She can't get off with anything less than two guys. She can't get off with one guy?
Anything less than two, she can't do it.
So she said if I can get another guy-- Stop talking now.
Stop talking.
Stop making words-- You don't understand. You're not getting it.
Don't say it out loud.
Please don't say it out loud.
I told her who you were. She's a fan.
She thought it would be hot.
You want to have a threesome with your own brother?
What's wrong with you? No, no, no.
She does. She does.
I have a plan.
You pretend like you're gonna do it, you're into it.
We'll all go out... ...then we come back, you pretend like you're gonna start in with us... ...and then leave.
You know, like you have to leave because you have prior engagements.
And then I'm there, she's all hot. Louie, she's all hot and then--
Look, it might not work, but that's my only chance, bro.
Look, you're my brother, and I like you a lot... ...so here's what I'm willing to do, okay?
Yeah.
I'm gonna go home now... ...and I'm not gonna talk to you for three weeks.
Bro.
Good luck.
Bro.
I don't know, I'm supposed to give my kids values.
I don't have any of those. I used to, but they're melting away.
They finally are.
You know, you get instilled with values by your parents... ...and by school, whatever else.
Society teaches you things, makes you--
Teaches you how to be a good person.
But you ever feel for your real values inside?
Like, who you would be if you had no guidance? I think about that sometimes.
What are the things I believe... ...in my marrow that I can't really--
That had to be shaved away?
They're coming back now. Like, here's one.
I really, somewhere deep down, I believe... ...that if you murder somebody and you never get caught, it's fine.
You kind of didn't do anything wrong.
Hello, Louie.
Mom.
Hello. Mom, I didn't know you were coming here.
Well, that's because I didn't tell you.
Girls, say hi to your grandma. Hello, grandma.
Hello, girls.
Listen, I gotta take them to their mom's.
You wanna come with me or....
Well, not really, I'm tired.
Okay, why don't you wait here and I'll be back in about half an hour.
Well, what do I do while you're gone?
Whatever you want. Make yourself something to eat.
That's not really ideal.
I am hungry, but I don't like fending for myself.
I didn't know you were coming.
I gotta take them, so--
Well, can't you make me something to eat first and then take them?
What are they doing here anyway?
You're divorced.
Mom. Sorry.
They don't know you're divorced?
Daddy, can we please go now?
Yeah, let's go, baby.
Sorry, Mom, we gotta get going, so....
Well, I think this is very rude.
I hardly ever see you, and I can't get a thing out of you.
Meanwhile, this one peeps she wants to go and you hop to it.
Bye, Mom. See you later.
I'm frankly amazed that you're leaving me.
I came all this way to see you. I wanted to surprise you.
MOM:
I need to lie down, have a cup of tea. Let's go, girls, come on. MOM:
I came a long way and I'm very tired.
My feet are killing me. Daddy?
Yeah? Why is your mommy like that?
I don't know, baby. MOM:
I deserve more respect than this.
Do you love her?
Yeah. Why?
I don't know.
Love is a weird thing.
If you really love somebody, you hate them at some point.
Your mother is the first person you ever love.
The first person that you love.
Who wants to talk to their mother anymore?
I mean, once you're a grown-up, your mother... ...who gave birth to you, made everything possible for you... ...when she's around you and your friends--
When you're alone with your mom, you can take it.
But when you're with your friends, she starts talking:
"We got here at 5." You're like, "Just shut up.
Just shut up. Just shut up."
Please, let there be another 9/11 right now... ...and there's a phone call about it so that I don't have to listen to this.
I'm just saying that if I had known we were going to take a taxi here... ...I would have dressed differently.
How do you dress for a cab ride, Mom?
WAlTER: Okay, are you guys ready? I'm sorry, yes.
Bring me a menu with larger type.
WAlTER: I'm sorry? This print is too small.
Bring me a menu with larger type.
Mom, I can read it to you.
I don't need you to read it to me.
He can bring me a menu with larger type.
Jesus Christ.
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
We don't have menus with larger type.
We don't have those menus.
Well, I guess we'll just have to eat somewhere else.
This salad isn't very good.
In fact, it's not good.
I hate it.
Mom, why are you here?
Why did you come here without telling me?
That's right, I came to tell you that I'm a lesbian.
What?
I said I'm a lesbian.
Okay.
You know, I think I always was, even when I was with your father.
We only had sex two times, one was for your brother and the other for you.
And it was... ...really disgusting.
At least it was for me.
I hated it.
All right.
And now I know that it was because... ...I wasn't paying attention to what my body needed.
This is my body.
It's worth something more than squeezing out two men... ...that I have less in common with than the man I married.
I mean, who needs any of you?
This is my body.
My body is a woman.
Woman!
Woman.
Woman.
Well, what do you think?
Don't you have anything to say?
Not really.
Wouldn't you like to know how I arrived at this?
What my journey has been?
You know, Mom.... [CLEARS THROAT]
I haven't seen you in a year.
I know. You've gotten fatter.
You know... ...Iast Christmas, you asked kids and I to come with you... ...to spend it at your house, we get there, it's dark and empty.
You were gone.
Yeah, I was in Phoenix.
You invited us for Christmas.
And then I decided to go to Phoenix.
It was very cold.
And my friend invited me.
My kids spent Christmas in a Holiday Inn... ...and Santa brought them each a bag of M&M's.
Are you serious?
Your mother tells you she just found out who she is and you have no opinion?
Nope. I don't care.
Uh-huh.
You're homophobic. Oh, no.
Ha, ha.
No, I don't care what you do with your vagina.
Honestly, you can take your vagina and shove it up your ass.
Be careful what you say about the place from whence you came.
From whence I came?
That's really-- I gotta go.
But I haven't told you about my wife.
I don't give a shit, Mom!
I don't care! I'm 42 now.
I don't even ever think about you.
You know, Lily asked me today why I love you.
I couldn't remember.
You know why? Because I don't.
I don't.
I really don't love you, Mom.
My kids don't love you, either.
Because you don't care that they're alive.
You don't even know that I'm alive.
The only person who loves you is my brother, and that's why he's a loser.
You didn't come here to see us.
You came to parade around your new identity.
Well, I don't give a shit, Mom.
I really don't.
Just go away, please, and don't come back.
Oh, Jesus.
This is bullshit, you need to know that.
Dude.
Here's another one, another thing I believe deep down, again... ...is that gay people should stop doing that, because....
And not for any moral or societal reason.
I have gay friends.
That's love.
You should respect what they wanna do with their lives... ...but they're just-- They're doing it wrong.
It's not supposed to be two vaginas smooshed together. It doesn't make any sense.
It's like two buckets and you hold the openings against each other.
There's nothing being accomplished.
You need to put a thing in a thing, otherwise what's--? What are you doing?
I mean, gay guys, I get it, because they're putting a dick in a place.
In an ass of a man, which-- By the way, what better place... ...to put a dick than a man's ass?
It's perfect. It's--
Even a vagina is awkward.
You have to go up and in, and you have to kind of....
Or she has to splay herself, and you have to go like this.
It just looks weird, even.
But a guy, you just walk up to him and your dick's in his ass.
That's it, you just walk up behind him.
And it's that simple. Just-- I'm gay.
That's it.
You just walk up, you're gay.
And then somebody goes into you.
That's how we were packed originally to save space.
But the two holes bump:
What the hell are you doing? It's wrong.
Not morally, just geometrically.
Bro, what are you telling me here?
Mom is a lesbonian?
Yeah. This--
This is bad.
This is bad news.
It is?
Yeah.
That's my mother. I'm her son.
I gotta go to a doctor or something and get checked out.
Checked out for what?
Stupid, if she's got the gay genes, I might have the gay genes.
So you're gonna get screened for gay genes?
Dude, what if I'm gay? Then you're gay, man.
I don't know.
There's no way she's a lesbonian.
How did she have kids if she doesn't do guys?
I don't know.
And why the hell did she tell you?
I call her every day. I don't know. She didn't tell me she was in town.
She wants us to meet her tonight with her wife.
My mother's wife.
What the shit is that, Lou?
What's this world coming to?
Maybe this is a good thing.
Mom has been a mess her whole life. Maybe this will center her.
I don't know, bro.
Why are you wearing a suit?
Hey.
Love you, Ma.
Robbie. Louie.
How's it going? Robbie, you're pretty fat too.
Is that all you boys do, get fat and die?
Oh, here she comes.
Okay, okay.
Can we have a seat, please? MOM: Jasmine, these are my boys, Louie and Robbie.
Hi, what's up?
Your mom's really cool.
That's great.
That's really great.
Can I start you guys off with a drink?
Yeah, I'll have a vodka on the rocks.
Me too. Just bring him a water, please.
No fun.
Heh, heh. Since when did you start drinking vodka?
Jasmine has been introducing me to a lot of new things.
She's been very good for me.
So let me get this straight.
My mother's married to a girl who's younger than me... ...and way hotter than any chick I've ever dated... ...or ever will date in my life.
Robbie.
I would think you'd be glad for me.
Aren't you happy that your mother finally found love?
Finally found love?
Mom, I've loved you my whole life.
That's all I've ever done is love you, and you didn't even notice.
Come on, who doesn't love their mother?
Jasmine loves me for me.
I love you for you.
I love you for you, Ma.
How many times did I told you I loved you?
I tried to remember when you said it to me, and I just can't.
Oh, I'm sure I said it.
When, Ma?
When? I've never felt your love, ever.
You know what that's like?
Your own mother?
That's why I'm-- My life is just so messed up.
Don't blame me for that.
I'm sure I said "I love you" somewhere down the line.
So you're saying you do love me?
Do you love me, Mom?
Stop it.
This is a restaurant.
I asked you a question.
Do you love me, Mom?
Robbie, don't go there.
If you do, if you love me, just tell me.
Robert, I will not be held hostage like this.
I do not play this game.
Game? What game?
I'm your son.
I'm just asking you to say that you love me.
What game, Ma?
So you go to school?
Ma... ...just say it.
Say you love me.
Ma, please, just say it.
[ROBBlE SNlFFLlNG] Please.
No.
You stay.
Ugh. This is a total bummer.
LOUlE: I think there's a hell, and I think I'm going.
Like a friend of mine was telling me about how he had sex with a hooker... ...and it turned out to be a guy, and it was a horrible thing for him.
And he had to get over it with therapy.
And as I'm listening to this, I realize:
"Shit, that happened to me too."
And the upsetting part of it wasn't that it happened, but that I had forgotten.
This wasn't, like, a landmark in my life like it was for him.
Like, "Oh, yeah, no shit.
I f**** a guy once back in Montreal.
I forgot about that."
[CRYlNG]
- Married?
- Divorced.
Next.
We need someone at our table.
- Deborah Barber, 38.
- Why?
- Not sympathetic enough.
Really?
Is there a weight limit on sympathy?
Uh, Maureen Fenton.
Housewife.
Divorced and remarried.
One daughter, 18.
- How did she do it?
- Handgun.
Killed her husband, then herself.
What's the daughter look like? She signed on to the class action?
One of the first.
- How will she do on the stand?
- Good. Then that's our test case.
Make sure she wears the cross.
But I thought Mr. Yates was doing it.
We thought so too, but he got cold feet.
We know this is very last-minute, Caitlin, but we think MRG Pharmaceuticals is ready to settle.
We just need a strong test case to, uh, motivate them.
If I lose, the others can't sue, right?
Well, they can sue, but it will be harder.
But I'll have to be on the stand?
It's a good case, Caitlin.
Really good.
And we need to make sure they never make an antidepressant like that again.
Sometimes I wonder if God forgives her, you know?
I have these nightmares of Mom not in heaven.
Your mom didn't do this, Caitlin.
The pills did.
You need to remember that.
I know.
Thank you.
Oh, say, can you see
By the dawn's early light
Of course she has perfect pitch.
- And this is bad, how?
- It's at the end.
Gives 10 percent to church, she works at a food kitchen once a month, and she volunteers at her kids' school.
- Private school?
- No, public.
She lives frugally, quietly.
There are no complaints from neighbors, staff or co-workers.
- So she's a saint? - For Chicago or the world?
There are no saints.
The smaller the sin, the larger you have to make the magnifying glass.
There.
- That's her husband. - Yeah, he's white.
We know.
This is not the South.
With some issues, everywhere's the South.
I'll think about it.
She's good.
No paper trail.
Keeps her distance from the machine.
No money I could find.
Nothing to get a foothold.
Hmm, my staff wants me to go after the miscegenation vote.
Her white husband?
Oh, yeah.
In some neighborhoods, that works.
I could work up some flyers.
- What else?
- I'm looking into some clinic visits.
There might be an abortion.
- What, she film it?
- No.
We're still checking it out.
- I am in a meeting.
- You're not gonna like this.
I was tracking a Q and A that Wendy did up at Albany Park.
You know, getting some shots of people waiting, trying to put together an idiot-supporter montage.
Go, Wendy!
What do you guys like about her?
She just makes a lot of sense.
You know, it's different with Obama now.
Politics is cool again, ha, ha.
No, no, no.
What's the case? No case.
That's the folder I stole from your car.
Ah, yeah, after you trashed it.
So you, uh, find a lot in there? Some.
You take a lot of notes.
Hey, do you know, uh, what l-LeGal is?
It's the illinois Lesbian and Gay Law Association.
They just rated Chicago law firms on their diversity in hiring gays and lesbians and transgenders and whatever.
Anyway, Lockhart, Gardner & Bond did not do well.
Even though I know for a fact that we have gay associates who just aren't acknowledging that they're gay.
Now, in this day and age, why would someone not be up-front about their sexual orientation?
Are you coming out?
You know the theory that I work under?
No.
It's better not to keep secrets.
Because then people don't go looking.
All right, ahem.
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.
Yeah. Uh, we need to talk.
No, I agree.
That's fantastic.
Okay.
MRG Pharmaceuticals just fired their team this weekend.
Alicia!
- What, their jury consultants?
- Their everything.
Our opponents just fired their lawyers. They're going with a firm from New York.
They're scrambling.
Who did they get?
We don't know.
Trying to find out. Probably Bernstein, Meyers.
They won that asbestos suit last year.
Bring them on.
They'll look like an army against us.
We'll have three women at the plaintiff's table.
They have half a dozen out-of-towners.
It'll be David and Goliath writ large.
- So I want you to handle voir dire. - Me?
- Yes. Are you ready?
- I am, yes.
Um, Diane, as your jury consultant...
Don't worry.
If they're bringing in New York, we need to play up our recognizability in Chicago.
The New Yorkers will object, but let them. They'll look like killjoys.
Diane, um, I just need a minute.
- And a cup of coffee.
- Ha, ha, okay.
Don't be late.
Hey, you'll be good.
Thirty to $40 million.
This could turn everything around for the firm.
Not to put too much pressure on you.
Can I have a regular coffee, please?
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
- The doors are heavy.
- Yeah. Uh-oh.
- What?
- Uh...
My bus pass.
I must have dropped it.
I keep my ID with it.
And I must have dropped it by the coffee cart.
Would you mind?
Yeah, sure.
- By the coffee cart. - Yeah.
I was by the bench for a minute, but I think it's by the coffee cart.
Thank you so much.
What are we waiting on, Miss Lockhart?
Uh, my co-counsel is just outside, Your Honor.
She is handling voir dire and she should be here any moment.
Is the defense ready for voir dire?
- Certainly, Your Honor.
- Then let's go. Mr. Canning.
Good morning.
First of all, I wanna thank you for your service.
And I probably need to explain a few things. What were you doing?
I'm sorry.
There was a...
Good morning, Mrs. Florrick.
I hope you don't mind.
We, uh, started without you.
Now, uh, before I ask you just a few questions,
I probably owe you an explanation.
I suffer from a condition, tardive dyskinesia, which is really just a funny word for a neurological disorder.
And it makes me do this and this and:
- But, uh...
- Uh-oh. if you just look at me long enough, you get used to it.
So, um, you know, feel free to look, and I won't mind.
Now, the good news is these pills.
I, um, take these every few hours and they don't make the symptoms disappear completely,
- but they do diminish.
- Objection!
Approach the bench.
Your Honor, defense counsel is using voir dire to argue his case.
You'll have to explain that to me.
This whole case hinges on a drug.
Whether, in fact, an antidepressant drug your client manufactured made people wanna kill themselves.
Your Honor, I'm simply trying to make sure that my symptoms won't be a distraction.
Part of my voir dire is to determine who will have a problem
- with my condition and who will not.
- Makes sense.
Overruled.
I don't want my symptoms to be a distraction, but I have to tell you that they do intensify when I become perplexed, and I'm just...
I'm really transparent that way.
So for example, I don't want you to be distracted
- when my opponents are question... - Objection!
So are we going to have a trial at some point?
Your Honor, Mr. Canning is trying yet again to taint this jury.
How?
I was helping you this time.
I don't want my movements to be a distraction.
No, sir, you are guaranteeing that the jury will be watching you throughout our testimony to see how you react.
My God, the cynicism here is breathtaking. Uh...
Maybe you have a problem with disabled people?
- Your Honor.
- All right.
Mr. Canning, let's try to keep the pained outrage to a minimum here.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
It's a sore point with me.
Mrs. Florrick, I understand your point, but I think Mr. Canning needs to inoculate the jury to his, uh...
What is the proper word?
- Condition.
- Condition.
So again, overruled.
Any luck finding my bus pass?
Because my driver might need it if the limo won't start.
Okay, we just turned into Goliath.
Hey, Johnny, you got a fast one?
I need to get out of here by 3.
Thanks.
- Oh, yeah.
Of course, it's the doc.
- Hey, Donna.
What's up?
You're talking to somebody.
I'm talking to somebody?
I'm talking to a lot of people.
Somebody from my office.
An investigator named Blake.
"Indecent exposure.
Public masturbation."
Look, I need you to stop talking.
Kalinda, four months, and this is what you come to talk to me about?
How are you?
Oh, yeah, Humanitarian of the Year.
Mr. Bay.
Are any of you Mr. Bay?
Mr. Bay, I'm Donna.
I'm from the public defender's office.
I'm here to defend you on charges of indecency, masturbating in a public park.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
Are you masturbating right now?
Don't do that. Get your hands out of your pockets. Don't say a word.
Who do you have for us today, Miss Seabrook?
- An innocent man, Your Honor.
- I'm sure.
Mr. Raymond Bay, an upstanding citizen, was arrested in Berger Park with his hands in his pockets, supposedly making, as the arrest report states,
"the motions of masturbation."
But, as we all know, the weather along the shore last night was unseasonably cold.
Mr. Bay was doing nothing more than what any of us would do, which was warming his shivering and, therefore, shaking hands in his pockets.
Let this one go, counselor.
Time served.
Next.
You're welcome.
You could make a lot of money at a big firm.
Why, when I meet so many interesting people here?
Everything's fine.
I didn't talk to anybody.
I didn't tell anybody your secrets.
- And if this guy approaches me...
- Blake.
I won't tell him how heartless you can be.
How insensitive.
How self-preservation is your number-one concern.
And after four months, you can barely say hello.
I won't tell him any of that, okay?
My sense is we got the jury we wanted, but the, aah, handicap of the opposing counsel has undercut my earlier assumptions.
- Meaning?
- He's co-opted our jury.
I don't get it.
He's handicapped?
And he's using it.
He's making the pharmaceutical company look like the good guy.
But medical testimony will prove otherwise.
We still have a slam dunk here.
We're acting like we're on the run.
Talk to the doctors.
Get them ready for some tough cross.
I'm trying to figure out how to broach this one.
Okay.
Why don't you give me a subject line?
Grace, your daughter.
She attended a Wendy Scott-Carr speech and spoke out for her.
We have it on tape, but not for public consumption.
One of our trackers caught it.
One of our trackers?
Yes. I have to keep tabs.
- Well, what did she say?
- How Wendy makes so much sense.
How there's so much corruption here.
I think she meant Chicago.
How much she likes her.
I'm paraphrasing, but succinctly.
Okay. I will talk to her.
Thank you.
And I'm sorry to have to bring this to you.
I promise next time I'll bring something good.
Elvatyl is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.
And this is the antidepressant drug manufactured by the defendant?
Yes, it controls depression by stopping the brain from reabsorbing serotonin.
I see.
Now let me ask you this.
In your latest clinical trial, you found that people taking Elvatyl were three times as likely...
Sorry.
They were three times as likely to commit suicide as those taking sugar pills.
Is that correct? Yes, it is.
Uh, it appears that the serotonin transporter gene 5-HTT increases the synaptic serotonin levels.
And, uh, how would you describe that in layman's terms?
In layman's terms?
Well, as a threshold matter, the mechanism for SSRI inhibition is poorly understood.
Think of it as a train switchyard, and the SSRI is the conductor, with the track the absorption rate and the 5-HTT gene as the coal.
Thank you.
No further questions.
Mr. Canning.
Thank you.
Doctor.
Talk to me about sex.
- About sex?
- Yeah.
This stuff you're talking about, this, uh, SSRL.
- Oh, SSRl.
- I.
Um, how does it affect a person's sex life?
Well, I'm not sure I understand the question.
Example, if there were feelings of jealousy, this drug would intensify them, correct?
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Mm-hm. But it couldn't create jealousy out of nowhere.
I mean, there would have to be reason for such jealousy to exist.
- Objection.
Beyond the scope.
- Sustained.
Guess we can dodge that question for the moment.
All right, doctor.
Getting back to SSRL's effect on a person's sex life...
Get lost.
So, what is it?
The abortion?
No.
But I know why she was going to the doctor.
Breast augmentation.
- You're kidding me.
- No, ha, ha.
Four visits over two months.
So, Mother Teresa got breast implants.
Does that humanize her or not?
- I would say not.
- I would say you're right.
She cares about the poor and yet how much did she spend?
Over two months.
Nineteen thousand dollars.
It's Clinton's haircut.
No, it's better than Clinton's haircut.
- And yet...
- What? The candidate.
He won't go there.
Since when did you care where the candidate wanted to go?
Give me that.
- What do you want, Eli?
- You can just go to hell.
- Uh-huh. And what have I done now?
- That was ours.
Go find your own. - You're blathering.
- I'm just warning you.
- Stay the hell away.
- Okay. I'm going now.
What does that do?
- Heh, he's a Childs plant.
- Mm-hm. I've known for a week.
Just waiting for a chance to use.
So go have him make a xerox.
That's what I like about you, Eli.
Sorry.
Um... My mom was great.
And there was this change that came over her after she started taking it.
- Elvatyl? - Yeah.
The doctor prescribed it.
I was going away to college and my mom...
You know, empty-nest syndrome.
Could you describe the change?
Within a day, she became more depressed.
She couldn't sleep.
She had nightmares that made her scream.
It was horrible.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Your stepdad had just started a new job.
Is that right?
Yes. Um, at Thurrell Interiors.
And he designed furniture?
Yes, couches and fold-out beds.
And he worked in a department with all women?
Yeah.
Why?
Oh, no reason.
I just... I want to be clear on the facts, that's all.
Eleven employees, all women,
- and your stepdad?
- Yes.
He liked his job.
He spent some late nights there, did he?
I guess.
They were trying to get out the spring catalog.
Well, what I'm saying is...
Actually, this is a list of items the police vouchered when they arrived at your mom's house.
I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to read for me item number seven.
"A gym bag."
"A bloody gym bag," it says.
And that was your stepdad's.
Uh, could you read for me item 7-B?
"Women's panties, black."
Uh, that's good.
And what does it say in the parenthesis here?
"Small."
Small. That's good.
Let me take that.
Caitlin, what size was your mom?
What size?
You mean, like clothing?
Yeah.
I guess a 12.
Twelve. Twelve would be large.
Not the size of these panties.
That's all right.
You don't have to answer.
I do have to ask you this question, though.
Is it true that your mom and your stepdad argued over a woman at work?
- No.
- A woman he was in love with?
- Objection.
No foundation.
- Sustained.
- Prettier than your mom?
- Objection!
Mr. Canning, that's enough.
My apologies, Your Honor.
I have no further questions.
And, uh, I'm sorry for your loss.
We need to regroup.
So how are we doing today?
Your office is small.
Yes, small but pure.
So in the third year, do you get a window?
Ah...
- Should I shut the door?
- No, no.
It's bad enough they think I'm gonna flip back to the defense.
So, what's up?
What do you need?
Why do you think I need anything?
Because you're Kalinda.
My, uh, usual sources have dried up here.
Sorry.
- I thought maybe you could help.
- Heh. It's a personal matter.
It's a new investigator from Baltimore, Blake Calamar.
- Blake Calamar.
All right.
And what do I get in return?
What do you want?
- Who was she?
- Woman who ran out of court?
An intern at Canning's firm.
Damn, if we could undercut Canning by subpoenaing her.
That's playing on his battlefield.
We need to pull him onto ours.
- Ours is the medicine.
- Problem with medicine is it's boring.
- Unh, but it's the truth.
- And the truth is boring.
He's got soap opera and we've got genetic science.
- That's always been our case.
- That's our facts.
Our case is what we do with those facts.
And right now our case is failing Caitlin.
- We need to make medicine sexy.
A lie always beats the truth. It can adapt.
It doesn't have to be consistent.
So we need to give the truth the drama of a lie.
Increased libido.
One of the side effects of Elvatyl is it has a potential increased libido in women.
Good.
We need to meet our last expert witness.
Who is it?
I'm sorry. You want me to say what?
One of the side effects you noticed was an increased desire for sex in public places.
That's ludicrous.
- It's in your study, doctor.
- No, it isn't. Subject 18.
She mentioned it in her trial interview.
She was merely mentioning that as an aside.
Our trial interviewer quickly brought her back to point.
Yes, that was unfortunate.
We also want you to discuss increased desire for oral and anal intercourse mentioned by Subject 35.
Miss Lockhart, this is...
It's what we need, doctor.
It's what Caitlin needs to win.
Well, I am not a clown.
I am not a performing circus animal.
I am a man of science.
Suit yourself, Dr. Lawton, but you've only fulfilled half your contract, and we'll be stopping payment as soon as you board that elevator.
Thank you, doctor.
Did you happen to videotape any of your animal trials?
Your most violent ones?
I just wanted to hear her speak.
That's all.
And I want you to hear her speak, but you did more than that.
You spoke to someone.
- How do you know?
- Someone videotaped you.
Who?
Are you angry at Dad?
No.
Somebody asked me a question, and I answered them.
- It's a free country.
- Yes, thank you, Grace.
You know this will hurt Dad.
Mom, she's really good.
She really is.
Yes, and if you were her daughter, you could talk about that.
So I just can't say what I think?
You can say what you think.
You're at home. - But just not to other people?
- When you're 18.
I know you think I'm being unfair.
But when you're older and you do something I disagree with,
I won't tell it to other people.
I will tell it to you first.
Mom, it's politics.
It's different.
No, this is family. It's not different.
Then, so if I disagree with something Dad did, I should just tell him?
What do you disagree with?
Wendy Scott-Carr went to town
Just to buy a boob job
Stuck some tissues in her bra And called it:
A personal matter, completely irrelevant to my job.
Wendy Scott-Carr's double-D
- Where did you find this?
- Online.
So it could be anyone.
It could be the other campaign.
Is it?
That is why the 5-hydroxytryptamine gene is a monoamine neurotransmitter.
Uh, thank you.
Now, in your clinical trials, what did you find unusual about this surplus of tryptophan?
Well, oddly, in some subjects, it made them desire anal sex.
Anal sex?
Really?
- Was that surprising? - Ha, ha.
Yes.
And also in one subject, it caused an increased interest in exhibitionist sex.
Uh, objection, Your Honor. Uh, relevance.
The defendant's case is built on the premise that Mrs. Fenton was jealous of her husband because he was having an affair.
We intend to show that Elvatyl, in fact, encouraged sexual activity, which could lead the jury to deduce that the Fentons' sexual relationship was healthy.
Stipulate that Elvatyl causes increased libido, Your Honor.
Thank you. We'd like to argue our own case.
Overruled.
So, uh, doctor, by "exhibitionist sex," you mean sex in public places like gas stations and shopping malls?
Oh, yes.
And in one instance, a public park.
Really?
And this was after injecting white rats with minimal doses of Elvatyl?
Yes, we wanted to see the impact of the 5-HT 2-C receptors on dopamine-producing cells.
You sure you couldn't find anyplace darker?
- You wanna go?
- What?
- You wanna go? - No.
I just want to make sure you feel anonymous enough.
You broke my heart.
- Not intentionally.
- Heh, well, that's a relief.
Donna, I'm not...
I'm not domestic.
- You think that's what I wanted?
- Yeah, I do.
You're just trying to keep me in line.
What do you mean?
You phoned me so I won't talk to your guy Blake.
Can't I be multitasking?
I can't do this again.
It hurts too much.
Then don't think about it.
Look, it's just now and we're just here.
And tomorrow we'll be someplace else.
And that's tomorrow.
I don't work that way.
I did not know he was available... There is no reason this witness...
All right, that's enough.
Mr. Canning, this is a very late addition to the witness list.
Your Honor, that's true, but as you know,
I myself was a late addition to this case.
- And given my condition, I can be a...
- Oh, come on.
Oh, that's right.
Mrs. Florrick gets offended when I bring that up.
I only talked to this therapist last night.
This isn't just any therapist.
This is the late Mrs. Fenton's therapist.
And as such, any conversations they had are subject to patient-therapist confidentiality.
- But Mrs. Fenton is dead.
- That doesn't matter.
The right remains intact after death.
In illinois, yes, but not in Wisconsin.
Dr. Booth moved his practice to Wisconsin in 2009.
He continued to counsel Mrs. Fenton both telephonically and in person.
This is outrageous.
You can't decide things differently based on geography.
Uh, actually, you can, counselor.
The therapist's notes and testimony regarding any post-2009 sessions will be allowed.
Anything before that is disallowed.
So you were seeing Mrs. Fenton the week before she shot herself and her husband?
Yes, I'm very sorry to say.
She was a very lovely woman.
I'm so very sorry, Caitlin.
What did she discuss with you at that time, Dr. Booth?
Well, uh, many, many things, of course.
But, uh, she was very jealous in the last month of her too-short life.
Jealous.
Of her husband?
Yes.
She thought he was sleeping with somebody.
Did she say who she suspected him of sleeping with?
She thought he was sleeping with her daughter.
That would be the plaintiff, Caitlin Fenton?
Yes, but, of course, this was just her suspicion.
That doesn't mean there was actually any reason to suspect.
Of course.
But did she give a reason for her suspicion?
Well, again, I would very much like to caution here, this is merely what she said.
But she found underwear among her husband's effects.
And did she say who the underwear belonged to?
Yes.
Her daughter.
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
So it's true, what the therapist said?
No.
I mean, my stepdad would...
I am so sorry.
He came into my room and he took my underwear.
Once.
It wasn't a big deal, but I told him to stop.
He said he would.
He pleaded with me not to tell my mom.
I am so sorry.
- So there were no sexual relations?
- No.
My mom came in and she accused me of tempting him.
This was after she started taking the pills, and that's why I was moving out.
I didn't wanna be the test case. I really didn't wanna be.
Don't worry.
We'll make this work.
What are you doing now?
Anything you want, Mr. Gardner.
I need something on a Dr. Randall Booth, a therapist in Wisconsin.
- Anything specific?
- Everything specific.
We need to kneecap him.
Whatever you can find, whatever we can use in court.
Okay. I'm on it.
Kalinda has been snooping around about me.
Don't worry about it.
If you say so.
Wendy Scott-Carr's Double-D
You know, it is pretty catchy.
But Wendy now is plastic
No one has taken credit for this video yet, but how are you dealing with all of it?
Well, it's difficult, but I think that's just modern politics.
Is there perhaps, a good point to be made here?
You have shot up in the polls as this friend of the downtrodden, and yet here we see you getting cosmetic surgery.
Were you concerned about your looks?
No.
About a year ago, I was diagnosed with stage-two breast cancer.
Not even my best friends knew about it.
And, um, I had to undergo a double mastectomy.
- I'm well now. - Ugh.
I mean, I know there was the option to live without reconstruction...
Anybody linking to the Wendy cartoon, stop now.
- Stop!
Stop.
- I'm sorry for taking so long to respond to these allegations, but it really is a personal matter.
And I just wish we would return to the issues.
- So, what have you got?
Oh, Kalinda, there you are.
- You're working late.
- To get a drug dealer off the streets.
Someone I'm sure Lockhart, Gardner will be representing tomorrow.
I can feel the moral gravity pulling me in.
So you called?
- Blake Calamar.
- Yeah?
It's an interesting read.
Do you wanna share?
In Baltimore, he was working two jobs.
But I guess you'd identify there.
The only problem was his second job.
It was protecting MS-13.
Yep.
When he wasn't protecting Bond and Associate interests, he was out protecting Baltimore's biggest meth gang.
- How do you know that?
- He was arrested. Never charged.
Bond got him off.
Oh, no.
It's official state's attorney business.
You've got a lovely little viper nest going on over there.
- Hey. - Hmm?
If I were you, I'd be careful.
Thanks.
My involvement with this Wendy cartoon has become a distraction from the real issues in this campaign.
A toast to a fallen comrade.
- Childs did nothing.
- Could have been us.
He had no knowledge of my involvement.
Not a bad day's work, huh?
Come on, Eli.
It's just you and me here.
You pointed the press toward him.
I was asked a simple question by a reporter and I chose to answer it honestly.
And so I apologize to Wendy Scott-Carr and to Glenn Childs.
Effective today, I tender my resignation from his campaign.
Thank you.
This announcement from Patrick Sturges is the latest...
Hey, Dad?
Dad?
And you were a patient of Dr. Randall Booth's
- before he moved to Wisconsin?
- Yes. We must object again.
And we must overrule again, Mr. Canning.
Now, do you know the reason why Dr. Booth moved to Wisconsin?
The reason?
Well, I guess it was me.
You?
Can you explain?
Well, Dr. Booth, he...
I was his patient and he slept with me.
I threatened to bring charges, so he...
Well, he decided to move.
Who found her?
- The witness, "her"?
- Yeah. Blake did.
And do you have an opinion about Dr. Booth's veracity?
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained. Nothing further, Your Honor.
Your Honor, it would be our preference to recall Dr. Randall Booth to the stand.
However, it's come to our attention that he's been hospitalized after a burglary attempt at his office.
We ask for a continuance until we can recall this essential witness.
Denied.
Is there anything else, Mr. Canning?
We ask for a five-minute recess so we can discuss a settlement with plaintiff's counsel.
Granted.
We're in recess until 4:10 p.m.
So he said, "What do we need to end this?"
I love it when they say "we."
This was during the five-minute recess?
Yeah.
The clock was ticking.
So I said, very simply, as though it were the most natural thing in the world,
"You wanna settle the whole class action?
Forty million."
I thought he was gonna come back at 10.
- He comes in at 30. - Ha, ha.
Little did he know we'd take 20.
So we settle at 35.
Thirty-five million dollars.
Of which we get to keep 7 million.
We buy another floor of offices.
Two floors. With a gym.
Why do I seem happier than you?
Because you won.
The firm is solvent.
You make it sound so end-of-the-year boring.
- This is big.
- It is.
So smile.
No, Kalinda, a genuine smile.
Look, there's Blake.
Oh, I get it.
It's because he found the witness and you didn't.
Yep, ahem, that's it.
Mm-hm.
Hey, look, Blake's got a date.
I've gotta see, heh, what kind of woman dates Blake.
- Hi, Blake.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hi. Oh, that's right.
You two know each other.
Oh, no, I don't think we do.
I'm Alicia.
No, he means me.
Hi, Donna.
Kalinda.
I was just heading home from work when Blake dropped by and asked if I wanted to come.
So you work with Kalinda?
I do. And how do you two know each other?
Um, from the state's attorney's office.
- You're pretty.
- Thank you.
If I wore heels like that, I would tip over.
Donna, could we have a moment, please? Your jacket.
I like it.
Thank you.
- A moment?
- Sure, let's have a moment.
Hey, good job today.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchen.
She's so not your type.
- Donna, you're so off-base. - Really?
How far off-base am I?
What's going on?
Are you trying to get back at me?
You mean Blake.
Right. You did say something about a Blake.
I didn't even make the connection.
- Look, I'm taking you home.
- No, you're not.
You're not connected to me anymore and I'm not connected to you.
Thanks.
- Mr. Canning.
- Mrs. Florrick.
- Are you looking for Diane?
- I am. Uh, we have a few details to work out.
You fought well, sir.
Yes, yes, I did.
Better luck next time.
Why are we laughing?
Well, because we're funny.
Oh, ha, ha.
Mrs. Florrick, you think you were my equal in that courtroom, but you were new math, I was, uh, advanced trigonometry.
Ah, well, too bad trigonometry lost.
I didn't lose.
Lockhart, Gardner stumbled their way into a $90-million class action.
MRG Pharmaceuticals asked me to lower you down to 50 million.
I landed you at 35.
I'm going home with a bonus of 1.3 million and stock options.
That's not losing.
But, hey, it's been fun, and maybe I'll see you again sometime.
We can mix it up in court.
Have a nice party.

- Excuse Me - Sorry
So I'm goanna make it on to the earlier flight, right?
Are you goanna check that? Oh.
No, I'm goanna carry it on.
It's got valuables in it. - Here - Thank you
- God! Excuse me - No, I'm sorry...
My bag is a little heavy.
I was looking at my phone. I hate it when people do that. You have a little... ...smudge
What are these?
Those are two barrelled carburettors for a Pontiac tri-power.
Those are exhaust tubes for a '74 Z-28.
I restore old cars, so...
Hair dryer
Oh my God.
I'm so sorry...
- This is getting to be a habit - Yea
Sorry about that.
- Here - Sure
- Boston?
- Yeah
Gate 20
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Gracia.
Hello
I'm sorry, you're not on this flight.
Well, I just checked in for this one 10 minutes ago.
It must be some sort of mistake.
I'm sorry, the computer shows that we're booked.
Listen Sherry.
Tomorrow my little sister is getting married.
I practically raised her...
I'm sorry, we are completely filled out.
Listen, can you help me out for a second?
She's my little sister. She's April and I'm June.
That's very sweet.
But the 11:50 will get you there by tomorrow morning with plenty of time.
Your boarding pass, sir?
Sometimes things happen for a reason.
Thank you.
I should've seen it coming, boss.
It came undone. Coming undone in our business means you need a margherita.
It doesn't mean capping a dozen people in a government lab and blowing it up.
It doesn't mean stealing an object of critical importance. Does he have the zephyr or not?  We believe so.
Uh, "you believe so".
I don't care what you believe, Fitz I need you to clear...
- Put it back on. - fix this. I want the Zephyr We'll have it in hand by the time he lands in Boston.
Find out who and what she is.
Should I just pick her up in Wichita?
No. I got a better idea.
Miss Havens.
We did find a seat for you.
Oh Fitz. What did you do?
No wonder these airlines are going out of business.
There's nobody on the plane.
The captain has turned on the "fasten seat belt" sign.
Please remain seated until the sign has been turned off, and it's safe to move about the cabin.
I'm June, by the way. I'm Roy Miller.
- Nice to meet you
- It's very nice to meet you Tequila on the rocks?
Yea, just in time.
Thanks.
So your sister's getting married tomorrow?
Excuse me?
Your sister is getting married tomorrow.
Congratulations. Yea, thanks.
- You know, I'm a bad liar
- I'm sorry. How's that?
April is getting married, but not until Saturday.
You had me fooled.
But, I do have a fitting tomorrow so I do actually have to go home.
Hope this isn't goanna be a rough flight.
It might be.
You know, Wichita is a long way to go for a carburettor.
It's not just any carburettor. It is a triple deuce.
I am restoring a 66 GTO and Kansas has the best scrap.
Really?
My dad had a garage, and when I was a kid, he bought this chassis.
He used to take us to go out and search for parts.
He died in '98 and now that April's getting married,
I just figured, why not finish it up and give it to her as a wedding present.
Kind of like a present from my my dad too, you know?
- That's nice - Yea...
I used to think that... someday ...when the last part went in.
I would just climb into that GTO, and start it up
Just drive and drive and keep driving until I got to the tip of South America.
- Cape Horn - Yea
- It is beautiful how it still is - Yes?
Pirate Islands.
- "Some day" is a dangerous word - Dangerous?
It is really just a code for... ...never
I think a lot about the things I haven't done
Diving the Great Barrier Reef...
Ride the Orient Express...
Travelling along the Amalfi Coast with nothing but a motorcycle and a backpack.
Kissing a stranger on the balcony of the Hotel Du Caps.
- Where is that?
- South of France
What about you?
What's your list?
Yours sounds pretty good.
- Thanks - No problem
I'll just put this up here. Is that all right?
You know, I'm goanna go back and use the restroom.
I'll help you.
Thanks.
Turbulence, huh?
I'll be out in a minute.
A strange in the balcony of Hotel Du Caps?
What kind of line is that?
It's a really good line.
Did you see his hands? By any chance?
They just snatched the bag right of the air.
Lightning fast reflexes.
Not cool
Obrigado!
Game's over, Roy...
Really?
Where's the zephyr?
Why is the girl on the plane?
Tell me.
Why did Fitz, put her on the plane?
Tell me. Don't move, Miller.
So what are you goanna do?
Are you goanna let this opportunity pass you by?
You're goanna walk right through that door. You're goanna get right up on this.  It is not your first rodeo, woman.
I decided to join you.
Sorry...
It's okay
- It's that tequila - Do not worry
My God, you're in a relationship. I'm so sorry.
No, that's not it.
Okay, I'm all ears.
What is it?
- Are we landing?
- No, not yet
Listen, there's no need to panic, I have contained the situation.
- situation?
- Uh, yea...
- We've lost the pilots - Where did they go?
- I mean they're dead - The pilots are dead?
- Shot, yes.
- They were shot?
By whom?
I did, actually I shot the first pilot and he shot the second pilot accidentally...
It's just one of those things.
Seriously... that's just great.
Really, I'm relieved you're taking this so well.
Where are you going?
I have to check out things, think about landing Would you mind putting your seat belt on for me?
This is weird.
- What's happening?
- Oh, hello
Sit down. Mayday.
Mayday. Mayday.
Everybody's dead in here...
Oh my god!
- Sorry?
- We're going down
Sure, this is a rapid descent.
Please, sit down.
- Sorry - Are you a pilot?
- Who are you?
- Shoulder straps
Secure it right down there.
Right there.
You're done? Here we go now. Why can't we just land at an airport?
No, no.
That wouldn't be a good idea. They'll be waiting for us.
What do you mean, waiting for us?
Who? I think, the less you know the better.
What?
Ok, we're goanna have to pitch down here. That's a truck!
Close, close!
God! - This is good - What's good?
Take a little sip of that.
It'll take the edge off.
- Are you shot?
- Yea, just a little scrape
That's good news.
June, we have to discuss what's goanna happen next.
You need to go to the hospital, and prison maybe.
There's people who'll come looking for you now.
Bad people. I feel a little weird
Oh yea, that will pass when you fall asleep, which should be a couple of minutes.
- What?
- I need you to listen, June
- Did you drug me?
- You drugged me - Yes, for your own good
These bad people who are going to come and see you, they're goanna ask you about me.
You need to tell them that you don't know me. June?
You need to tell them you don't remember anything... ...and you need to avoid getting into any vehicle with them at all costs.
Who are them?
- Serious people, June.
They'll probably identify themselves as federal agents, and they'll DlP you.
Dip me? In what?
Disinformation Protocol.
They'll tell you a story about me about how I am mentally unstable, paranoid...
I'm violent and dangerous and it'll all sound very convincing.
I am already convinced.
Here's a few common DlP cue words to listen for:
Reassuring words.
Words like stabilized secure, safe. If they say these words particularly with repetition,
- ...it means they're going to kill you - Oh, God! ...or intern you somewhere offshore for a very long time.
Stay with me.
- If they say you're safe...
- They're goanna kill me
- Do not get in what?
- Vehicles
Any vehicles.
You know?
Just run. - I'm run - Run
And if they ask you about me...
I don't know you.
I don't know you at all Who are you...?
Eat a good breakfast, June ...Back to our top news story of the morning...
According to the FAA, approximately at 7:30 last night... All passengers died when the aircraft suffered turbulence.
The plane was passing through an area of turbulence and may have been affected by... ...wind-shear or lightning storm causing an electrical failure.
Now this is all pre-conjecture, and all that's left of the plane... I'm coming!
Remember, do not tell anyone
Rodney? Oh, thank God.
I wanted to make sure were all okay.
Why?
- You were on that flight from Kansas, right? - Yea
- I saw on the news about the crash
- What news?
What crash? - Anyway, you're alive - I'm alive.
Yes.
June...
I told myself that if I found you alive, that...
- I was goanna ask you to dinner
- How about I call you later, okay?
It's just another day. It's just a normal day. She's moving.
- Wow... and I gotta love the boots - Yea..
I know
I promise I'll wear heels on the day.
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yea - So, this weekend.
I was thinking about dad's GTO - Really?
I was sitting there and I was wondering how you'd feel about maybe selling it.
You wanna sell dad's GTO?
- Ben and I. We really want our own place
- Excuse me Anyone here belong to that blue truck parked outside?
Yea, why?
You're about to get a ticket.
Forget to put enough quarters or something.
I hate getting tickets.
Oh, excuse me.
Please step inside miss.
I'll just go grab a few things.
Miss Havens, good afternoon.
Special Agent Charles Fitzgerald.
Will you join us inside the car for a moment?
We know you were on the flight with him last night.
The one that crashed.
Who are you again?
FBl.
- You do know Mr. Miller - No, I don't
Well, we chatted a little bit before we passed through security.
I see.
And once you were on the plane,
What happened then? More chatting?
- Is this funny to you?
- No
He's dangerous Miss.
Havens, and out of control. - He said that you'd say he was crazy
- So you did talk to him
And what about me?
No, not you specifically.
About whom then...
Simon Feck?
I don't know who that is.
Look this is getting really twisted around and I think I should probably call a lawyer.
We're goanna take you to a secure location, until agents can have Mr. Miller contained... ...some place safe.
- With you? - Yes, ma'am
You wanna tell me where we're going?
Fellas?
Do not worry, you're safe. - Excuse me?
- You're safe with us
I wanna know where we're going.
It is just a shortcut until the situation is stabilized, to keep you safe.
You said that already.
Because, I meant it.
What is Jackson doing?
Shooter, shooter!
Get down! Get down!
Shooter on the freeway. The dot is on your back.
Follow me now!
Are you insane?
I'm not going out that door.
God! - Hey June - I can't see
- Get out of the way - Open the door
Open the door June...
Beautiful dress, by the way.
Wait a second.
Who are you?
What are you doing?
- Hey June - What are you doing?
Please unlock the door.
Unlock the door, that way I can help you.
June, door...
Just pull over!
Oh my god!
C'mon over here... You're doing good.
Hold this.
Well, well, well!
Check this out.
Nice.
These guys load the barrel.
You're doing well June.
Excellent driving.
Beautiful dress Is it for the wedding on Saturday?
- Uh-huh - Yea, that'll be nice
Please... stop shooting people, okay?
I understand, you're in charge.
You stay here while I go have a word with the guys in the truck.
Okay? - Okay - Okay?
Actually I'm just goanna go shoot them, and I'll be right back.
By the way, your timing, when you opened that door was sublime.
You saved us, I hope you know that.
You saved us.
Hey, wait!
Wait!
There you are.
June?
Rodney?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Hey guys, say hello to June.
- That's some dress - Thanks
- Everything all right?
- Yes
No, it's...
It's complicated.
You know what?
I've been feeling the same way.
You wanna talk?
Maybe over some pie.
My point is...
My point is, that plane crash made me think about our breakup.
You know this bell went off.
Like "Bing" Rodney, why have you given up?
You're being passive.
Getting back at her because she didn't want the ring.
June does not want to be engaged right now and that freaks your mom out.
Big deal!
What about all the things you and June wanted to do together, huh?
Our list, camping in Vermont, with my brother and Sheila
Tickets to the Blue Man Group...
I wanna talk about the plane crash. Okay?
- Sure. What about it?
- I was on it
I was in... it So you were in the plane crash?
I wasn't supposed to be on it, but I was and there was this guy who was...
Some sort of like secret agent or something and he...
He killed everybody on board and then he landed the plane
Next thing you know.
I wake up. I'm in my room. I have no idea how I got there.
He must've drugged me or something.
And then I go to April's wedding cuz I had to wear this ridiculous dress
And then these other guys, these other agents come.
They snatch me off. Next thing you know,
I'm in Grand Theft Auto on the I-93. Why're you touching my hand?
Because I'm here for you
- Geez, you are so stressed out - Yea
And I get it, I completely understand I mean...
- Wow, June! - I know...
Your little sister is getting married and that is stressful.
What are you talking about, Rodney?
You didn't even listen to what I was talking about.
I would be the same way in this situation.
What can I do to help?
- We can bring the guys over...
- No, no, no, no, no... Christ...
Hi June.
Look, I'm sorry if I'm interrupt anything but...
I'm Roy Miller.
Rodney Burst.
We're running out of time, and...
Maybe I didn't make it clear enough, but we're goanna have to stick together because of our... ...situation
In case you didn't notice, Rodney is a fireman so he's perfectly capable of handling any situation that comes up, thank you very much.
- You can leave us alone. - I have no doubt.
Ever since I was a little kid, I've had a great respect for firemen
And the fact of the matter is, I don't think you guys get paid enough
- You're an engine tech?
- Yea, engine tech.
- Have you taken your lieutenant's exam yet?
- Yea, we're goanna
- How's that going?
- It's a bitch
Do you have a do a tour of that hall...
That's where the action is...
- Rodney...
- House of flames
I've often thought...
I... I should've been a fireman
What? Is this the guy?
Sorry, who are you?
I'm the guy?
- I'm the guy - This is the guy
Rodney whatever happens, please for your own safety
- Please stay out of it - What are you talking about?
Everybody get down!
Everybody get down or I will blow her head off
What did I just say?
- Rodney what did I say?
- Just calm down
Sorry, thought you were making a move.
It's okay, do not move Pies for everyone!
Everybody gets pies, but no ice-cream.
We can survive, people. Lincoln knew it. That's why they got to him.
No one follows us or I'll kill myself and then her.
- Get in the car please - No
Watch your head.
- 560 Harris.
They're getting into a blue Volvo - Rodney!
Oh my God!
Rodney!
It's okay, I shot you through and through.
No bone, nowhere near the femoral artery.
Okay?
It's goanna be better for you to grow bone.
It's all good. Okay?
You good?
Good?
I was forced to enter the restaurant, June, because it proves you're my hostage.
Which cleared your name, with the locals at least.
That is a start. Something to build on.
You shot Rodney.
Yea, I did.
- But I asked him to stay out of it - You shot Rodney
Might be the best thing that ever happened to him.
Yea, right because we all should get shot every now and then.
Rodney is a good guy, June.
But not really right for you.
In my opinion, but a good guy...
He took a bullet. He's goanna be a hero.
Probably get a promotion.
Stop the car.
Stop the car!
It's okay.
- Stop the car! - I can not
I want to leave, stop the car please, now
I'm not one of those, "I told you so" kind of guys, but I did warn you to stay off the plane last night.
When?
When I said that sometimes things happen for a reason.
That's not a warning... That's not a warning, Roy...
That's an expression or a bumper sticker.
Next time try: June, if you get this plane you will fucking die.
Maybe they did meant it when they said that I will be safe.
Do you really mean that, June?
Yea.
Did you feel safe with them?
Do you think that I do now? Okay.
Just so you understand, right now out there on your own, your life expectancy is like zero...
With me, it's up here. Without me, here.
With me...
Without me...
I would advise going home, but you know?
So, right now I need another car to keep moving
And someone else depending on me. Someone, whose life is in danger.
Someone who trusts me... Every second I waste chasing you, I'm letting him down.
Rodney, what was it that you were thinking when you performed the heroic action?
Well, I didn't think, I just did what any man would do in that situation.
- You should be so proud - Thanks It really didn't even hurt, it was kind of like a bee sting.
What a brave fire fighter.
Doctors tell me, Rodney's going to be okay.
It's just a flesh wound. A true blue Boston hero...
Back to you, Tom.
That's what it's all about.
That right there is what everybody wants.
A Burger King toy?
Open it.
It's warm.
What is it? A battery.
A battery?
It's code-named Zephyr.
I'm not sure, if it's just...
It's high output. It never runs out.
What do you mean never?
That little thing there, is the first perpetual energy source.
It's the sun. So what, your flashlight never runs out of juice?
It can power a lot more than a flashlight, June.
- Really? - Hmm. How much more?
A small city or like a submarine.
It's big.
The guy who invented it, is barely out of high school.
Simon Feck.
I was assigned with another agent to watch him at a facility lab in Wichita. and the other guy, the agent, is the guy who picked you up this morning.
Fitzgerald.
A couple of weeks ago I found out that he was going to sell the battery... ...and kill Simon.
So I got Simon out of there, you know, some place safe.
Went back for the battery and Fitz set me up.
He made it look like I went rogue.
That's when I met you.
So...
So what's next?
What is the plan?
Maybe get some rest.
Pick up Simon and get you back to your sister's wedding.
I am pretty good at what I do, June.
Tonight... ...we're safe.
Scout's honour.
"Safe and secure?"
Good night, Roy.
Were you really a boy scout?
Eagle Scout.
- I was a brown eagle - That's cool
Good night, Roy.
Pies for everybody... everybody... Everybody gets pies... So, what do you think?
Are we looking at another player?
We're looking at a pawn.
I talked to her and so did he. She owns a garage.
No passport. Gone nowhere. Been nowhere.
She's a nobody. You've been two steps behind since this began, Fitz.
Are you sure someone's not taking you to school?
Clean this shit up.
Brooklyn, NEW YORK. This is the safe house?
Simon!
Simon?
Stay close.
Simon!
No time to play.
What is all this?
Simon.
It's what he does.
It's kind of late.
Please keep guard.
Hmm...
Made in Austria.
Who are these people? Are they Fitzgerald's guys?
No, these are other guys
Other bad guys?
Worse guys.
Hold them.
Worse guys?
Now, June, listen carefully and do exactly as I say.
On three, I'm goanna lay down cover... ...and you're going to run to those shells over there, okay?
Okay
Ready...? One..
Sorry...
I panicked.
What number would you like?
Let's just stick with three.
Okay... 1, 2, 3.
Good work, thanks
Could be Antonio Quintana's men.
He is a Spanish arms dealer.
He also wants the battery.
Ready?
Let's move.
June, June...
What the...?
How the hell are we goanna get out of here?
Where the hell is Simon?
- I don't know, but he left a message.
- Message?
What I need you to do right now is to wait here
I'll go find us a way out of here
Wait, wait.
Stay down.
Roy!
June...
June!
June!
You keep screaming my name and it is freaking me out.
Okay, I understand.
- Drink this. - What is that?
Brotine-zero.
They're goanna smoke us with D5. Where's yours?
Shit. Sorry.
June...
Will you listen to me?
We'll be out of here... ...in a couple of minutes.
I gotta do something...
Alright. We gotta go June.
We've been hit!
But, it's okay.
We get through this, we're home free.
Ready.
Set.
Go!
We're almost there.
ALPS Hey there, sleepyhead.
How long have I been out?
18 hours.
Where am I?
My place.
We're off-grid.
No one's ever found me here.
It's a shame we can't stay longer.
We gotta rendezvous with Simon.
He's fine. I figured out his code.
He's crazy 'bout trains.
He used the password I gave him and went to Austria.
You drugged me again, Roy.
Yea.
You can't do that!
You weren't coping well.
I'm not sure if you were awake, they would have even let you live.
What am I wearing?
A bikini.
We're in the tropics.
How did I get in a bikini?
June, I've been trained to dismantle bombs in pitch black... ...with nothing but a safety pin and a Junior mint.
I think I could get you into those clothes without... ...looking.
I'm not saying that's what I did, but...
Sorry...
Reflex.
Yea, I deserved that.
Hit me again.
I won't stop you. June?
June...
June!
Pins and Junior mints...
"I'm not saying that's what I did."
Shit! What is this thing?
Movement,Alert
5826, Amapola.
That's a '67 Grand Prix.
April!
April!
I know, I'm ok!
I'm ok! I'm ok! Listen, April....
April...
April....
April, can you hear me?
April.
April, can you...
I know, I'm ok! I'm ok! I'm ok!
What is Miller doing? Who is the girl?
We do not know Antonio. We traced her phone to the Azores.
We're in range now.
Until they contact the agency.
Perfect timing.
Lunch is ready.
You must be thirsty.
It's a coconut... it's loaded with electrolytes.
Whoa... Ok...
OK, just... wow.
Yea.
You got skills.
My dad wanted boys.
Let me go!
You can get out any time you want.
I'll show you.
Hands like Houdini.
Turn your palms down, and all at once... ...throw your hands to the ground.
And your hips back...
Nice.
That was good.
Who are you?
Really.
I don't understand...
Run. I don't understand.
I came on a plane.
My phone was secure.
It's secure. Unless you didn't make a call.
No, I didn't make a call.
I took a call.
You took a call?
It was a quick one.
I thought we were off the grid, and then my phone rang.
It was my sister and I had to take the call.
No, I can't get into that.
I can't get into that thing.
Just put me out.
Use Broton 7 or whatever.
- It's okay - You're grabbing my neck.
You asked me not to drug you.
Okay...
Hands like Houdini... hands... Roy?
Monte Casale, ALPS.
I can't feel my face!
Hey, it's time...
Pull on this traction system...
I have control of 50,000 metric tons. This is diesel hydraulic.
Don't you want to see your Zephyr?
Yes...
- Excuse Me. - Tell me lady.
Can you tell me where we are?
Of course, we are in Austria.
Austria...
Would you like some breakfast, Miss?
Yea, that would be great.
Thanks.
Okay, I'm goanna have some pancakes.
Scrambled eggs and... a glass of milk.
Excellent.
- A Harvey Wall banger, please.
- Yes, sir. Incoming Call.
Unknown Number.
You know, statistically you're a lot more likely to die... ...riding on a train than any other form of transportation.
10.3 times more likely than dying on a plane.
Simon?
Simon Feck?
Yes.
My name is June, I'm a friend of Roy Miller's.
Have you found him yet?
Have you seen him?
No, not yet.
Don't you wanna answer that?
Yea.
But I can't, I'm not supposed to...
It may be Roy.
But he told me not to answer the phone, because the signal could be tracked.
Oh, that's right.
Stay in the room.
I'm with Simon. Did Roy happen to tell you why I'm here?
Are we supposed to meet him here or...?
What did you say that drink was...
Harvey...? It's a Harvey Wall banger.
Do you mind ordering me one of those, 'cos it looks great?
I'll just be right back.
You just stay here for a second, I'll be right back.
Something's wrongs.
It's getting hotter, Roy.
She didn't answer her phone..
I told her not to, which is good news.
I left a note.
A Post-it.
Roy, maybe the issue here.
This is getting too hot; we need to cool it down.
Maybe she went to get something to eat.
Good. C'mon...
May I help?
Yea, I'm feeling a little bit strange.
So is it okay if I hang out here for a while? Of cause, I'll go get you some water.
Here you go.
Antonio Quintana wants to know, where is the battery.
Where is the battery?
I'm sorry... I'm looking for...
Roy...
Miller.
You know him? I...
He's an assassin... platinum grade. - He's trying to find Simon. - Oh my God...
And to kill you...
Simon?
June, Simon.
Simon, Jume.
I'm okay, I got it.
Simon, please move!
You have quite some balls.
Hands like Houdini!
I'm so sorry...
But you were trying to kill me.
That's disgusting.
Oh, my God. Just die!
Oh shit...
I gotta get you guys some place safe...
- He's not on the train.
- Oh, really?
The cameras at the station show him.
He must've gotten off before the train stopped.
Always the classics, boy.
Salzburg, Austria...
Very nice.
Yes. No, we just got here.  No, we're talking now...
It is a beautiful city. Yea.
I've never seen anything quite like it.
Neither have I.
I have to go out for a bit...
Okay...
I...
I was thinking about ordering some room service.
Maybe we could have dinner.
That sounds great.
9 'o clock?
9 sounds great.
June...
Could you do me a favour?
Just stick around here... that's better.
Yeah of course, where else am I goanna go?
See you in a minute.
They're not goanna hurt you.
You are too valuable to them.
Just breathe and listen to the music.
This is something special for you. I know you like it.
Cool! Thanks.
Order as much room service as you like, but do not leave the room,
- Okay? - Alright
I really need to talk to you about the Zephyr later..
And we will.
Can I get you something? Red wine please.  Right away.
You seem different. Do I?
So, who's your company?
She is beautiful.
The blonde. She seems capable.
I've just met her.
She is a nobody.
Someone I picked up on the way.
That's a shame.
This is getting boring.
Are we goanna do the deal or not?
Don't speak to me like that.
I'll speak to you any way I please, Tony.
We both know you're lucky I'm here.
I have the battery.
I'm on a schedule.
The world of is full of bad guys and people are calling.
Ask him the price...
Alright then...
What's your price?
I have a figure in mind...
What's it worth to you? Are you angry about your island, Roy?
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, Tony.
I'm Isabelle George, director of counter espionage at the ClA.
I'm sure you are.
Forgive me, I just...
I just don't know exactly what to believe.
That's understandable considering that the last five days you've been fed a steady diet... ...of misinformation and fantasy by an agent of ours who's recently gone rogue.
He said that Fitzgerald was the one who wanted to steal the battery.
Well, let's examine the facts.
Miller told you that he was protecting the Zephyr from people who wanted to misuse it.
But now he's trying to sell it to an international arms dealer.
Antonio Quintana.
One of Europe's leading weapons manufacturers.
Ask yourself, Miss Havens...
Has Roy Miller said anything to you that's proven to be true?
He used you as a mule to carry the battery through security, Miss Havens.
He's been playing you.
He's a spy. That's what he does.
He lies for a living.
Any love, empathy... we train that right out of them.
What did you imagine?
The two of you would move into a condo together? Get a dog? You can't have a life with him.
That's fantasy. But you can have your back...
She's been gone eight minutes.
We need you to get back to the hotel before Miller.
What am I supposed to do?
Alright...
This pen is a transmitter.
Once you have confirmation that Miller has not hidden the Zephyr... ...that it is somewhere nearby or on his person.
You confirm this by simply clicking the button.
Sorry, I'm late.
Everything go okay?
Sure enough.
It's getting hotter.
So, did you get your price?
I followed you tonight.
You have nothing to say.
Here's to Wichita...
Where we first... ...bumped into each other?
Do you think that was fate, Roy?
I do not believe in fate.
But I believe in luck.
I don't know what to believe.
That hurt more than I thought it would...
I'm going home.
He promised that if you turned yourself in, he'll protect you.
I love your optimism.
Never lose it.
Get him.
Get her out of here. He's not here, Sir.
They tell you you're going home?
You sit inside the helicopter, June?
You can't go home.
Shit! Close the door!
Get in the car!
Don't let him escape. He has the battery!
Hold your fire!
He has the battery! ·
They secure the kid?
Yes.
They found Roy?
We'll find the body.
We have to.
He went down with the Zephyr.
Thank you guys... Schwedelbach, GERMANY.  Aah...
Fitz...
Fitz, I think we just made a wrong turn...
Ram stein is that way, West...
And I think we're going South.
You know what, you're right.
Tell him, we're back on track.
I don't have the battery, but no one's goanna get it now.
Yea, I've got the next best thing.
I'll see you in Spain in two days.
Hi, Wilmer!
- How was the party?
- It was nice I see the 'Goat' is still out there.
Yea.
I thought it was a wedding present.
It was, but...
I think I wanted her to want it more than she wanted it.
Okay...
This just come in?
G-body Grand Prix.
Largest hood in history.
Gonne be a real beauty'.
Ru-pa...? No... Fe-pa...?
No, it's... Amapola 5826...
Let's see...
That's like an hour from here...
I think it's a safe house.
Here we go... Who's out there?
I am not afraid to use this.
Oh, Frank! Look at her...
I wanna know what she's doing in my lawn in the middle of the night?
I have the pistons you ordered.
Pistons?
For the '67 Grand Prix.
Molly, I didn't...
You're all wet.
Please, come inside.
That Pontiac you have out there, Frank, is a real classic.
I really love pre-70s Grand Prix'.
So, you two lived here long?
This old place?
It's been our home for forty years. Sit down, honey.
Have a cookie.
Frank thinks we should move, but I am uncomfortable.
And we can afford to stay, thanks to Publisher's Clearing House.
You won Publisher's Clearing House?
Twice.
Plus we won two lotto quick picks and Frank doesn't even remember buying.
Oh, I didn't buy 'em. Oh, yeah.
Like you didn't order pistons off the Internet.
You don't know what you're typing into that computer, Frank.
In a couple of minutes we'll have your clothes, honey.
So...
Roy Miller?
This was one of his safe houses, wasn't it?
What the hell are you talking about?
Honey, what's this all about?
I'm sorry, I thought...
Maybe I must have this all wrong.
I was just... looking for some information about my friend Roy.
If you'd like to change, there's a proper room right there.
That's our son Mathew.
We lost him in Kuwait.
It was a chopper crash.
He saved the lives of two of his crewmen.
He used to always take care of everyone.
He was an Eagle Scout.
This was taken the day he got that swimming badge.
He could swim clear across lake Sunapee with practically one breath.
I just...
I believe we've...
I'm June Havens.
I'm Molly Knight.
This is June Havens and I'm leaving a message... ...on my own machine for whoever's listening to this phone call.
I have the Zephyr and I'm ready to make a deal.
I'm sitting on Route 28, right outside New Hampshire.
And if you want the Zephyr, you better come and get it.
Hey fellas.
So...
You want the Zephyr? I got the Zephyr.
It's right here.
Come and get it.
Seville, SPAlN. Come on...
Let's go! Welcome to Espana.
It will take a while, for it to take effect. Today is the Festival of San Fermin.
Have you ever seen a bullfight, Miss Havens?
My name is Antonio Quintana.
I know who you are.
What did he give me?
It is something we're developing in my company.
A new kind of truth serum. Really?
I have a few questions for you about the battery, since we both know what you gave to my men was a joke.
I don't like you very much...
The truth?
Good.
It worked.
You know, I really like Miller though...
Did you know I was totally wrong about him in Salzburg?
He wanted me to hear that phone call so that I would follow him.
I'd turn him in and then he could get me home safely.
He was trying to protect me.
It's crazy that I could feel so powerful and capable around him.
Shut up...
- He takes care of me - Shut up!
Where is the battery?
Where is it?
I bet you've never made a girl an omelette, have you Antonio?
Don't test me, June.
Or got her to her sister's wedding on time?
It's really the little things. Honestly.
- They count so much - Enough!
Okay! Miller is dead!
Roy Miller is dead.
He's out.
Está muerto! Comprendes? No.
No, he is not.
He can hold his breath for a really long time. Si está muerto!
He is dead!
I'm not goanna ask you again.
If you don't tell me what I need to know... ...you're goanna die.
I do not know where the battery is.
Then why did you tell everyone you had it?
Why? Because I was trying to find Roy.
This white bitch is driving me crazy.
Antonio, wherever there's bad guys like you around Roy's not too far away.
You are going to kill her. Kill her.  You're goanna die.
Finally.
Nice to meet you...
- John - Antonio.
Too bad you couldn't get the battery.
Where is the boy?
I thought you would not?
Why don't you follow me down to the river and bring the money?
Okay.
Is this thatching? Because, I've never seen anything like that before. We have really good architecture in Boston, but nothing like this.
It's time to kill her. Is this all weapons money, or is this family money?
Gardens...
He likes gardens, huh?
So, do you guys take care of the garden?
It's so relaxing... This really is a happy place.
Look at these trumpet flowers.
Ok, Eduardo, you don't have to pull me around.
You can just tell me where you want me to go, okay? This way, Blondie.
See, now we're communicating.
Bet you're taking me some place safe and secure.
Some place special. Antonio's special place.
Oh, Antonio has a special place?
That's so nice!
Everyone should have a special place.
Come on.
Luis?
Is there a problem, Eduardo?
Shut up!
- Hi Roy. - Hi June.
You're supposed to be home.
You're supposed to be dead.
- I can explain - You don't have to
I came here to get Simon.
I just get caught up in something.
Oh, that's cool.
Be careful. His name is Eduardo.
Eduardo, habla Engels?
I need you to listen, because when you wake up you'll call your boss and tell him... ...that Roy Miller, that's me, has the battery and escaped with the girl.
- Oh, you have the battery? - Yea
Will you tell him?
Comprende?
Let's go.
I'm worried about Simon.
I haven't seen him and my tracker is blank.
Being with you is so exciting.
You excite me, Miller.
- Took you long to get here - 7 'o clock
I think I feel like having sex.
You know, really great sex.
Did they give you something?
You need to rehydrate.
Roy...
Roy...
Roy...
June...
June?
You don't seem very happy to see me, Roy.
What? Not really.
I am happy.
So the red dot is us? No, we're yellow.
Red dot is Simon.
Grab tight.
Hello? It's Eduardo!
He says his name is Roy Miller, He said he has the battery.
- That's impossible.
- She disappeared with him.
No! Miller is here.
There they are!
This way.
Follow me!
Oops...
There's Fitz. I see him!  Slow... slowly...
Okay.
- Here - Wow! - What next?
- Lead them
June Havens!
You've got skills.
- See you down the hill - Are you sure?
No.
Freeze right there, Roy.
Hey, Simon.
- Get down on your knees, now.
- Roy!
Put 'em in the water, in the water.
I just want the kid, Fitz.
Okay, well I hope you brought what you want otherwise,
I'm goanna have to kill him, and I swear to you I'll do it.
I believe you. Just like Wichita.
- I understand - Okay
I'm just goanna get the battery.
It's right here.
Please don't give it to him.
Roy, please don't give it to him.
Put it on the deck. - Roy!
Roy! Roy!
Roy! - Easy - Please don't give it to him.
- Easy
- Simon, it's goanna be okay
- Roy, don't give it to him
Shut up!
- Okay, okay, I'll make another one - Simon don't talk
Make another one?
Am I dying?
No, you fainted.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
No, I've been trying to tell you...
Why is it hot?
Because it's filled with power.
The battery! I messed up.
It's deteriorating. I know.
It's unstable.
You're a smart guy, Simon.
I know you'll figure it out.
Oh, my God. Roy, you're shot.
Get help.
You're beautiful, June.
Stay with me.
We're here Miller, we got you.
June...
WASHlNGTON It's been a spectacular couple of weeks, Miller.
It's good to see you, Isabelle.
Hey, guys.
We cleaned house, Roy.
I have to thank you for that.
I trusted the wrong man.
That happens.
Simon's happy.
He's got a new life.
Where June?
I sent her home.
She gets it.
She knows you two lead different lives, and she's moving on.
As should you.
You gave up those things.
You let go of who you were. Family.
Friends. That's the deal. Why are we still talking about this?
Because the agency invested a lot in you.
And you are an asset only as long as you stay focussed.
You look good.
Get some rest.
We're goanna transfer you to a secure facility tomorrow.
For your safety.
Nurse, what did you give me?
Brotine Zero.
Stay under there, Roy.
You're dead.
Make way, please.
Going to the mortuary.
Do not worry, Roy.
I got this.
It's time for a vacation.
Hey there, sleepyhead.
What day is it?
Someday.
Someday, Roy.
What am I wearing?
A pair of shorts.
How did I get into these shorts?
Roy, I've been trained to rebuild a 6 speed transmission... using only a pair of pliers and a crescent wrench.
I think I can get you into a pair of shorts without looking. I'm not saying that's what I did.
You're both the navigator and the DJ.
We have a long way to go to Cape Horn.
With me.
Without me.
With you.
Put some tunes on the radio, Mr. DJ.

Pension Services, please.
WOMAN: Thank you, Mr. Moses, please hold for your representative.
(PHONE RlNGlNG) (PHONE CONTlNUES RlNGlNG)  Hi, this is Sarah.
It's Frank Moses. Hey.
Frank.
What's going on?
Not much.
I just called because they didn't send that check out again.
Oh.
I can't believe they haven't worked this out by now. I'll make sure they send another one out today.
I'm so sorry.
Well, what are you gonna do?
So how's your avocado?
It's got two green leaves on it.
Yay!
I told you, you could grow something. Well, it was pretty close.
It was life or death.
I'm not kidding.
It could have gone either way.
How's your day going?
My day?
My day sucks.
Your day sucks?
Yeah. Right now I just want to travel.
I'm thinking Chile. Sounds like an adventure.
I don't know.
You ever been to Chile?
Yeah.
You have?
What's it like?
Mountains.
That's it? Well, it was night, I....
It was...
Look, I gotta go.
Okay. Sure.
No, sorry, it's just Gladys.
What?
"It was night." Hi, Mr. Moses!
Hi. -FRANK:
Did you start that new book?
-I did.
And, what's it called?
It's called Love's Savage Secret.
Nice. Is it any good?
It's terrible.
I love it. It's awful.
It's about this fashion designer and his supermodel girlfriend, and they get recruited by the ClA to stop an assassination at the Milan spring shows.
Well, who doesn't like Milan in the spring?
I guess.
Anyway, I gotta do something for excitement.
My landlady keeps trying to set me up with her bridge partners' kids.
She just told me she thinks I'm gay.
I try not to judge.
What? Shut up!
I'm not gay.
So here's something weird.
I'm actually gonna be in Kansas City next week.
In person?
Mmm-hmm.
Wow.
That could be a bad idea.
It could be.
You still there?
Yeah. Yeah.
Why don't you call me when you get to town?
Or... Yeah.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay, bye.
Okay. All right.
MAN ON RADlO: Come in, Unit One.
Come in, Unit One.
Unit One, respond.
(WOOD CREAKlNG) (HOME IN YOUR HEART PLAYlNG)
Don't you know I got to find me a home
Right now in your heart I'll travel over miles...
Hey, aren't you going to invite me in?
No, I don't think so.
But I bought you dinner!
Wow. Wow!
Wow! And you live with your mother.
Awesome.
Yeah, of course.
You have no job.
You, mister, are not getting any of this.
Hey.
It's me.
Frank. The avocado?
Why are you here?
Get out of my house!
-I told you to call first.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Would you just listen to me?
Please?
Stop that!
Get back.
Go away. Stay away from me!
Is that my bag?
Yeah.
You packed it?
Yes.
Did you vacuum?
A little, yeah, it was messy.
Get back. Get out!
Please.
We have to leave. Right now. Stop it.
-Hey!
Just listen to me, please!
-Someone is trying to kill me.
-What are you doing?
Listen to me! -Intruder! -Help!
-They've been trying to kill you, too.
Why would anyone want to kill me?
Because we've been under surveillance. They've been listening to our conversations.
Why?
Because of the way I talk to you.
What?
They know I like you.
(TlRES SCREECHlNG) Listen to me.
Right now.
Out the back door.
No way!
FRANK:
Don't get me wrong, I know it's crazy.
Don't think that I don't think this is crazy.
And it (SlGHS) couldn't be more different than how I'd hoped to meet you for the first time.
But sometimes things happen.
And I just hope that someday you and I could be sitting somewhere, comfortably and look back on this as the great, big adventure that it is.
(MUFFLED MUMBLlNG)
(ANGRY MUMBLlNG) (YELLlNG)
I'm a little hungry, too. What should we get?
(MUFFLED) Pizza. WlLLlAM:
Listen, hon.
Yeah, lots of boys get bullied at school.
I know, but you can't solve it by intervening like that.
No, I don't agree with you.
I know, it's hard.
I'll talk to him about it when I get home.
Mmm-hmm. No, I should be on time tonight.
Milk, two percent?
Okay, love you, bye.
Listen.
I can make you rich.
Don't you know who I am?
Of course, I do. (CHOKlNG)
(CELL PHONE CHlMES)
This is off the books. Total blackout.
Yes, ma'am.
There's your target.
WlLLlAM:
Retired analyst.
He was ClA.
Is that a problem?
No.
(I WANT TO BE LOVED PLAYlNG)
The spark in your eye sets my soul on fire Your voice is like a angel above  The touch of your hand, woman Drives me insane
Sorry.
(PANTlNG) Wow.
If you let me go now, I won't press charges.
-There's no hard feelings.
-We're way past charges.
How do I always attract losers like you?
I was in the ClA.
Yeah, I bet you were.
I'll bet you're a spy.
(SlGHlNG)
I have to go see someone now...
You're just gonna make me sit here?
Like this?
You couldn't be safer. No one knows where you are.
Oh, no. Don't do it.
-Just hold still. -Don't please. I don't want it.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Your eyes are so beautiful.
Want to watch TV?
(MUFFLED COMPLAlNING) Be back soon.
Is that thing acting up again?
Oh, hi, Marna, yeah.
Give it a rap, will ya? See if you could get it going for me.
Of course.
I don't know why you don't fix this old thing.
Better picture.
-Try a little bit more to the left.
-Okay.
Yeah.
That's just perfect.
Thank you very much, Marna.
Unbelievable.
Should be ashamed of yourself.
(BOTH LAUGHlNG) It's nice to see you, kid.
It's good to see you, too.
So what's up?
Met a girl.
No. Complicated.
Got a visit from a wet team.
At my house, 24 hours ago.
Did you ID any of them?
Kinda.
This used to be a gentleman's game.
And you know I love you.
Bye.
Independent South African hit team suspected of killing a New York Times reporter.
Stephanie Chan.
You know her?
No.
Somebody has a serious hard-on for you, kid.
Yeah.
But why now?
I'm retired.
Just have to dig some more.
Watch your back, too.
I'm 80 years old, I got stage 4 liver cancer. -What the hell can they do to me?
-They can still shoot you.
Well...
I never thought this would happen to me.
What?
Getting old.
(FRANK CHUCKLES)
I mean, Vietnam, Afghanistan.
Green Springs Rest Home? (BOTH LAUGHlNG)
Go figure.
So Moses made 22 calls to Pension Services and that didn't stand out to you?
Unbelievable.
Hoorah.
Have Endercott intercept the girl at the Hotel Capri.
Hey, Mike, change of plans.
She's just fine.
I can take you home.
Oh.
I gotta take you down to the station first to get your statement.
Then there's a couple of federal guys that are gonna want to talk to you.
I gotta say, I think you're pretty amazing for breaking free and keeping it together like you did.
That's impressive.
I'm gonna go back and get my purse...
I can have somebody bring it downtown for you.
-Get in the car! -Ow!
Let me go!
You're hurting me.
(SCREAMlNG) (ENDERCOTT GRUNTS) Am I gonna die?
No.
You just need some sleep.
I may vomit.
Wow, this is just like Love's Savage Secret.
I am high.
You have such beautiful green eyes.
(WOMAN SCREAMlNG) Wow.
You really are ClA.
Officer down.
Corner of North Peters and Conti.
Suspect is a white male, 30s, black suit and a tie, driving a black Tahoe.
(DOOR CLOSES) (SlRENS WAlLING)  OFFlCER:
Put your weapon on the ground!
Put your weapon on the ground now! Right now!
JOE: So you're saying this was ClA sanctioned?
All right, Thelma, thanks.
I owe you one.
Bye.
So it's like that, huh?
Yeah. It's like that.
Where are we?
How did we get to New York City?
Wow, I really hate you right now.
I was just hoping you'd be a little more understanding of the situation.
I was hoping not to get kidnapped.
Or drugged.
I was hoping you'd have hair.
So it looks like none of our dreams are coming true, at the moment.
Sorry about that.
Thanks for saving me.
I guess.
No problem.
Not my best first date.
Not my worst, either.
Until we find out who's trying to kill us, you're gonna have to stay with me.
For how long?
I don't know.
Whoever's trying to kill us also killed a New York Times reporter.
She used to live in Chinatown.
Okay. Here we go. Let's come in here.
-You just hang onto this tape.
-Oh, no.
No, you said we were just gonna talk to her.
We are. This'll help.
-The woman just lost her daughter.
-I know. You can't just go around duct taping everyone.
People are basically kind of decent.
That hasn't always been my experience.
Let me try and talk to her.
-What? -Just let me do it.
MRS. CHAN: They told me to be patient.
The police have done nothing.
They said it was just a burglary, but nothing was missing.
She was scared.
We're hoping we can do more.
You worked with my Stephanie?
She sent me this.
I got it in the mail on the day she died.
What does this mean?
I don't know.
I tried dialing the numbers.
Police had no idea.
Where did Stephanie go to college?
SARAH: Why are we here again?
Those numbers on Stephanie Chan's postcard are actually a call number for a book.
Call numbers start with letters.
In the Library of Congress, yeah.
In Harvard-Yenching, it's a classification for Asian literature.
How could you possibly know that?
(SPEAKlNG MANDARlN)
You speak Chinese?
Unbelievable.
Hank Maestriano died 2 weeks ago. Car crash.
Daniel McGinty.
Heart attack. Last week.
(WHlSPERlNG) But if this is a hit list, why is this guy still alive?
Gabriel Singer.
Flies cargo planes.
That's a good question.
(BUZZlNG) Hell of a mess.
Come on.
(DlALlNG) Joe Matheson, please.
Hold on.
Marna.
Hello?
What?
Joe.
Frank Moses is not a retired analyst who's never worked in the field.
This guy has a history.
CYNTHlA:
That's a file number.
You need to visit the back room.
You're going to meet the Records Keeper.
I didn't even know this place existed.
It doesn't.
Ah. Frank Moses' file.
You gotta be kidding me.
Frank Moses was one of the most effective black op agents we've ever had.
He retired drug-lords, terrorists.
Hell, he toppled governments.
Yeah.
He was truly gifted.
Why was he retired?
He got old.
Then some thumb-sucker came along and tagged him "RED."
Red?
Yeah.
RED. R-E-D.
"Retired:
Extremely Dangerous."
Yeah. Yeah.
They don't make them like that anymore.
Thanks.
I'm gonna need a data haunt.
Every flak he was ever involved in. Every agent he's ever run.
I want NSA telephone surveillance, voice recognition...
FRANK:
We have to find Marvin Boggs.
His name was on the list too.
Marvin died two years ago in a fire. Yeah.
Marvin has died many times.
Oh, can we have that one?
Wow.
All we need is a banjo.
(SHUSHlNG) Keep your voice down.
Don't make any sudden moves.
Just stay close to me. -Don't use your cell phone.
-You took my cell phone.
Don't talk about cell phones. Don't talk about satellites.
Seriously?
Why are you trying to kill me?
I'm not trying to kill you!
Oh, yeah. You are.
Why would I be trying to kill you?
Because the last time we met, I tried to kill you.
That was a long time ago.
Some people hold on to things like that.
I'm not trying to kill you.
Okay?
So that makes us friends.
Right?
Right.
Good.
You wanna take that knife out of my balls now?
Who is she?
Sarah. She's not trying to kill you either.
Yeah. Hi.
I don't stay in the open.
Come on, I'll show you the house.
What's that?
Decoy.
He lives in a car?
Come on in.
Why do you live here when you have the other place?
Let's put it this way.
When the helicopter passed over the house last year and I could feel their eyes on me.
Wet like peaches.
I have a list here.
It was written by a reporter who's now dead.
Along with everyone whose names are on that list.
Well, almost everyone.
Frank, how many times have I told you?
You cannot trust the system!
I told you when you're in the system, they switch the flip and you're done.
Man, satellites, cell phones, chips, net, the web, the dentist...
Marvin!
That list is the one we need help with.
Yeah, I gotta check the files.
FRANK: Of course you do.
Thanks, man. Wow.  This guy's insane.
Well, he thought he was the subject of a secret government mind control project.
This'll take a minute.
Sure.
As it turns out, he really was being given daily doses of LSD for 11 years.
-In that case, he looks great.
Yeah. -Fantastic.
Got it.
Guatemala.
Fall 1981.
Five of the guys on this list were there, not including us.
San Benito.
Just outside.
Injun territory.
Yeah.
Was a little village.
Everybody was killed.
Civilians. They told us, "Go in there. Clean it up.
You think everyone on this list was there?
Damn it.
Damn it!
Do you know what's wrong with this country?
They're all trying to kill us?
Exactly!
Is there anybody still alive on that list?
Gabriel Singer.
Frank!
I never thought I'd say this again.
I am getting the pig!
Who's she talking to? Just take it easy.
Frank, we gotta get rid of this broad.
I know a great place, just up the road. Lots of alligators.
We're not getting rid of the broad.
I like her.
Okay?
What's the angle? No angle.
I like her. Okay.
So, they pull her voice from the pay phone, probably right now, install the recognition software and back-trace it to Singer.
So then we show up, they bring out the satellite, and we're fried with Y-rays.
How you doing?
Good, fine.
November niner 745.
Wow.
Singer is going to be in Mobile tomorrow.
We can catch him at the airfreight terminal.
How about that?
MAN ON PA:
The Sunset Limited with service to New Orleans, Houston, Tucson and Los Angeles now boarding platform five.  It's the final boarding call for the eastbound express...
(SCREAMS) No, please! No!
You smell like Washington.
Who do you work for?
Coldwell Banker, I'm a real estate agent!
Please, don't hurt me. No, no. Who do you work for?
-What? -Who do you work for? Marvin!
Frank, she's one of them.
She's been following us.
There's a camera in her bag.
I'm gonna kill her now. No, please don't kill...
Don't let him kill me! Please! Marvin, just wait, would you, please?
Marvin.
Look.
Marvin.
No camera in the bag.
Go, ma'am, now.
Get a car.
Try not to kill anyone.
She was following us, Frank.
Sorry.
"She has a camera in her purse, we have to kill her?"
Seriously?
See you in a minute.
Gabriel?
Right?
Gabriel Singer?
What's this about?
Guatemala.
1981.
San Benito.
I can't talk to you.
Pair beats ace.
I got one for you.
What did this twice-decorated, west Texas Jew-boy Marine pilot say to the Chinese New York Times reporter?
I give up.
Nothing.
I didn't tell her a damn thing.
The reporter's dead now.
And everyone she spoke to is either dead or a target.
That includes you.
Oh, Christ.
They had me fly this guy out there in the dead of night.
Hairy little airstrip in the middle of nowhere.
He was ClA, some dorky little spook in a suit and tie.
Remember that guy?
-Black glasses.
-Yeah. He was giving the orders. GABRlEL:
He picked up a package and I flew him back out.
What was the package?
It wasn't a what. It was a who.
Frank! Frank! It's that helicopter.
We're in an airport.
It's the same helicopter.
November niner 748 Charlie.
November niner 748 Charlie.
See?
Frank, November niner 748...
FRANK: Is that a 4? This is a 4.
Charlie.
Is that a 7?
What is that? GABRlEL:
I'll tell you what it is.
(GUNSHOTS) I told you she shouldn't have made that phone call!
MAN: We lost visual on target.
All right.
Shake the tree.
-You'll pay for the breakage?
-Yeah, Roger that.
That's right, old man!
-Old man?
-No respect.
Can I kill her now?
She called me an old man.
Pig!
Open the pig!
Okay.
Grenade!
MARVlN: Damn satellites!
Boop to that!
Yeah, you just stay right there.
FRANK: You okay? MARVlN:
What are you doing?
Old man, my ass.
God damn it!
-Smoke and thermals.
Obstructed view.
-Signal's fading.
Nice shot. -Thanks.
-We should get out of here.
(SlRENS WAlLING) You really know how to show a girl a good time, Frank.
I will kill you, Marvin.
Take it easy, man.
She likes you.
(SlGHS)
How can you tell?
Notice how she sticks around?
'Cause if women don't like you, they don't stick around.
She doesn't have much of a choice. Does she?
Sure she does. Really?
You think so?
You know, if it is the ClA, then there's only one place that we can go to find out why they're coming after us.
Yeah.
We're gonna get killed there, for sure. In or out?
No. Of course I'm in. I'm just saying.
We're gonna need some serious help.
This is not the kind of help I meant, Frank.
You're not actually gonna go in there, are you?
I don't think I can go, Frank.
The last time they put some electrical wires in some not very nice places.
Listen, hang onto that for me.
I'll be right back.
(EXHALES)
Hey.
Be careful.
Tell Ivan Simanov that Frank Moses is... (DlSTORTED ECHO)
IVAN:
I have to say this is the last thing I expected when I got up this morning.
I have many times dreamed of killing you.
But now
you are a pensioner.
Couple of years now.
Time passes.
As we get older, things seem less important.
Still
I owe you for killing Igor.
-Igor the Butcher.
-He was a great asset.
-He was a pig.
-He was my cousin.
I'm sorry.
To Igor.
The Butcher.
He's not dead.
I flipped him.
No.
He owns a string of 7-Elevens in Orange County.
(EXCLAlMS)
He weighs 500 pounds.
(EXCLAlMS) (LAUGHlNG) (IVAN CLAPPlNG)  Drink.
Who are we drinking to now?
Veronique.
She was mine.
-Impossible.
-Yes!
Whatever she got, it was worth it.
(SlGHS) I miss the old days.
I haven't killed anyone in years.
That's sad.
But
I think you are not here for the vodka.
I'm going to break into the ClA.
I need your complete security layout of Langley.
Cracks. Codes. ID swipes.
All of it.
Amusing as this would be, it is beyond my reach.
(SPEAKlNG RUSSlAN)
A favor from Frank Moses?
I can't believe you're actually letting me come along.
The badges Ivan gave us are for a General Harlow and a female nuclear physicist from Los Alamos.
Sheniqua Johnson?
You're adopted.
Okay.
This is so cool.
(BEEPlNG)
(GASPS)
-What? -Uh-oh. -I dropped it.
-(ALARM BLARlNG) (BUZZlNG)
Freeze!
(ALARM CONTlNUES BLARlNG)
The General has dropped his contact lens.
Perhaps you'd like to help us?
Sorry. Found it!
I found it! I found it.
(SCAN WHlRRlNG) Have a good day, sir.
Gentlemen. (LAUGHlNG) My God!
What do you suppose the punishment is for what we're doing here?
Death. Maybe life in prison.
Awesome.
(SARAH LAUGHlNG) Why are you holding that button?
The Russians give you the code?
No.
Changes every six hours.
Will you hold that for me for a second?
Yeah.
It's unbreakable.
Wow. Come on.
Mr. Moses!
Been a long time.
I'm gonna need to see that Guatemala file.
Guatemala?
-Yes.
-Uh-huh.
I think I can help you. (HENRY LAUGHS)
Great. It's been a whole new world around here since you left.
Guatemala.
You know, you're gonna catch hell for this.
After what I've seen?
Oh, I should tell you, there's a new guy came down here yesterday looking for your file.
Name of William Cooper?
6'1"?
Cute hair?
Hair was cute. (BOTH LAUGHlNG)
But I thought he looked a little tough, though.
You take good care of yourself, Henry.
You, too, Mr. Moses.
Change of plan.
(BACK IN THE SADDLE PLAYlNG) Bad move, Grandpa.
I'm back I'm back in the saddle again  I'm back
Kordesky trained you? Yeah.
I trained Kordesky.
(GROANlNG)
I'm back I'm back in the saddle again (SCREAMlNG)  Son of a bitch!
Seal the building.
Bald, white male, 50s, wearing white shirt, blue pants, shot in the shoulder.
Hi. (ALARM BLARlNG)  We should go.
We should go now.
I've got checkpoints at every exit.
What about the fire? Shut off the alarm.
I told you, there is no fire!
-We need to evacuate.
-No, this is just a diversion.
You make sure everyone gets checked.
Help, help!
Please come! I can't stop the bleeding.
You okay, sir?
FRANK: Make a hole!
Make a hole! Whoa!
Hold it.
Let me see him. It's not him.
Yeah, yeah.
Go ahead. FRANK:
Fellas, help me out, here.
Marvin? There's still something wrong with this guy's head, Frank.
FRANK: You're really something, Joe.
Marvin, you okay?
I don't want to talk about it.
Joe?
Joe who was dead Joe? -She with us?
-Yeah.
Not dead.
Just retired.
I guess calling wasn't an option?
-Can we go?
-Yeah! JOE:
You let yourself get shot? God damn it.
(YELLlNG IN PAlN) CYNTHlA:
Out. -You okay?
-Thanks, Doc.
What did he get?
I have no idea.
You just had your ass handed to you by a goddamn retiree.
What did he do?
What did Moses do to earn a lethal finding?
I have not been read into it.
I like you, Cooper.
You're ambitious and you get results, but someone just kicked in the front door of our house, so you better get your shit straight.
Nothing in your mission is changed.
-You're still bleeding.
-Mmm-hmm. Must have nicked something in there.
This is so bad.
It's not that bad.
People get shot all the time.
No, they don't, they get paper cuts.
I mostly get shot.
We're gonna have to find somebody to plug this leak.
Could go to Eagle's Nest.
Huh? Then we all get shot.
I'll just go in by myself.
Want a vest?
(SlGHlNG)
Wouldn't do any good.
Frank Moses.
Hi, Victoria.
Are you here to kill me?
No.
You've been shot.
Tell Marvin to stand down before he gets hurt.
Who's the girl?
FRANK: She's with me. -JOE:
Vicky. -Joe! Oh, Vicky.
Sexy as ever.
You old snake charmer.
Sarah, this is Victoria.
Best wet work asset in the business.
And a true artist with an RPN.
What's that?
I kill people, dear.
You were lucky.
How'd you do it?
-What?
-How'd you make the transition?
Here you seem so calm. At ease.
I love it.
I love it here. I love the baking. I love the flower arranging.
I like the routine.
Well... -I do get a bit restless sometimes.
-Mmm-hmm.
I take the odd contract on the side.
I just can't stop. Yeah.
Tell me about it.
You can't just flip a switch and become someone else.
Put some pressure on it.
So...
Tell me about your lady friend.
Makes me think that I could actually have a life.
A real life.
Oh, Francis, you're such a romantic.
What?
A romantic. It's why I've always been so fond of you.
Victoria...
You're all hard on the outside, but you are... You are gooey on the inside.
Gooey.
The entire back half of the Guatemala file has been blacked out.
But there's a list.
11 names. Plus one that's been redacted.
All dead. Except for Frank and Marvin.
All the names on the reporter's list are in the file, too, but she has an additional name.
Alexander Dunning. Somebody's protecting him.
Dunning is the CEO of Browning-Orvis.
Gangsters.
FRANK: Defense contractor.
Very connected.
If the ClA is protecting him, he's under surveillance.
We could go see him.
You're not going without me. JOE:
Well... We're getting the band back together.
That's nice.
(CELL PHONE BUZZlNG SOFTLY) Yeah?
We just got a tip. RED has a new target.
A tip?
FBl's on the scene.
I'm on my way.
VlCTORlA: The FBI has a lookout position on the east perimeter.
MARVlN ON RADlO: Copy that.
(CLEARlNG THROAT) Alexander Dunning.
Pleasure to see you, Secretary Baptiste.
(IN FRENCH ACCENT) The pleasure is with me.
They're in.
Frank said you wanted me with you.
Yes, I thought it might be nice to have a bit of girl time together.
Get to know each other.
And I just wanted to tell you that in all the years I've known Francis,
I've never seen him like this.
So if you break his heart,
I will kill you. And bury your body in the woods.
Wow. Okay.
Oh, this is gonna be fun.
ALEXANDER ON RECORDlNG: Here at Browning-Orvis, we have a longstanding commitment to humanitarian causes because exemplary corporate citizenship is our highest calling.
As a company with global reach and global interests, we have global responsibilities.
Now sometimes I'm asked, if this commitment to ethical behavior affects the bottom line. And my answer is always the same.
Yes. It makes it stronger.
This is my safe room. Sound-proofed. Reinforced.
Swept for bugs daily.
You could fire a gun in here. No one would ever know.
Mr. Dunning.
I cannot imagine a more perfect place to conduct our business.
You do know that there's a surcharge for any arms deliveries to countries that are embargoed by the United Nations.
For every problem, monsieur, there is a solution.
(BUZZER SOUNDlNG)
Excuse me.
Mmm-hmm. What are...
ALEXANDER ON RECORDlNG: How many CEOs can say that?
So how did you guys meet?
We started talking on the phone.
I guess I liked that it wasn't real.
Of course now I'm a fugitive, the ClA wants to kill me and I'm hiding in a hole.
I was in love with an agent once.
What happened?
Well, I was with Ml6. And the relationship wasn't sanctioned.
So when it came to light, my loyalty was questioned.
And I was ordered to kill him. It was a test.
What did you do?
I put three bullets in his chest.
Okay.
Who the hell are you guys?
You don't remember us?
We remember you.
You're the guy whose shit we cleaned up down in Guatemala in 1981.
And the question is, who did you fly out of there?
You don't have any idea what you're getting into.
First of all, you can't touch me.
Sure, we can.
FRANK:
Oh, yeah. Where'd you get this?
Home Depot.
-How much?
-Ten bucks.
You want nuts? Nipples?  Potty trainer?
All right, stop it.
Nuts.
Stop it.
For the love of Christ, stop it! Stop already!
Now you got something to say?
We extracted a young lieutenant who is the son of the late Senator,
James Stanton.
Robert Stanton?
Vice President of the United States.
You're saying the Vice President killed all the people in that village?
Yeah. Went completely off the reservation.
And that New York Times reporter?
Did she pressure you?
Yeah. She called me. Twice.
So I called the V.P.
And what did you think would happen then?
Oh, whatever. I made him Vice President.
You kept your mouth shut and the Stantons made you rich.
ALEXANDER ON RECORDlNG:
Been working with our partners in the developing world to root out corruption and... (RECORDlNG SKlPPlNG)
Okay.
I will pay whatever it costs to get rid of this thing.
JOE:
We're not here for your money, home.
We're here because that New York Times reporter had the list of names of everybody who was in Guatemala.
And everybody on that list has been ordered killed.
Except you.
I had nothing to do with that.
Don't you see?
He's trying to clean up his past and get rid of me in one shot.
He's trying to cut me loose before he runs for President.
VlCTORlA ON RADlO:
We have some major activity out here.
Looks like we're blown.
We're in position.
Perimeter's set. No one's getting out.
They're moving a team up the east side.
Are you gonna let me talk to them?
-(SCOFFS) -I can negotiate something.
Thanks, when we want your help, we'll get out the drain cleaner.
Listen, Plastic Man, those bastards out there probably have orders to kill me, too.
I hope so.
Why?
'Cause I'm a bad guy?
I'm scum?
Can I just shoot him now?
No.
You don't have people killed.
I have people killed, I'm the bad guy.
Remember?
(SNORES) Not worth a bullet.
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
Hello?
How's retirement, Frank?
It's been a real blast.
If we have to come in there and get you, it's gonna be messy.
You bet.
Real messy.
I've got my orders, Frank.
They come from the Vice President.
He's ordered these hits to cover up the war crimes he committed in Guatemala.
I find that hard to believe.
How did you know you'd find me here?
Some anonymous untraceable tip?
Here's the deal, Frank.
You're gonna walk out that front door and give yourself up.
You have my word no one will shoot you.
I'll personally take you in and you will get to tell your side of the story.
You got 60 seconds to decide.
What's it look like?
VlCTORlA:
There's no clean exit.
They seem to be coming from everywhere.
VlCTORlA:
We're running out of options. If we had a distraction, I could cover you to the woods.
(FRANK SlGHlNG) Looks like there's not a lot of options, kid.
I mean somebody's gonna have to make the hard choice if we´re gonna get out of here alive.
Been wild.
Wild and crazy.
But I wouldn't want it any other way.
An honor.
Good luck.
(PHONE RlNGlNG) FRANK:
Tell your men to hold their fire. I'm coming out.
He's coming out.
All units, hold fire.
Repeat, all units, hold fire. MAN: Roger that.
Get behind.
Come out now.
I've got you covered.
(GUNSHOT) Who fired the shot?
Tell me when the boys make cover, we'll move.
Now.
(EXCLAlMS) (INDlSTlNCT CHATTER)  They've got Sarah.
Frank, you're no good to her dead.
We gotta move.
Come! Now is not time to waste.
Ivan?
(GREETlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE)
It's nice to see you again, Ivan.
Did he just call you "bunny"?
Life sometimes is complicated.
(IVAN SPEAKlNG FORElGN LANGUAGE)
To Joe.
ALL:
Joe.
Not to push the bounds of propriety, but don't you think we ought to discuss the fact that the ClA's being used by the Vice President as his personal hit squad and that they'll do whatever they can to find us and kill us?
Options?
We could go public.
Yeah, right.
That didn't work very well for the reporter.
And what about Frank's girlfriend?
They'll kill her so fast.
First they'll interrogate her.
They probably already got the wires.
Then give her a little snorkel.
Give her a jump. -Bring in the dent.
-VlCTORlA:
Marvin! God!
You are such an idiot.
(DOOR CLOSES) I want to show you something.
This was done to me by the love of my life.
It seems that what we had was not meant to be.
But now she sits outside my house drinking vodka.
Three bullets in the chest.
When I woke alive,
I knew she still loved me.
Or else it would have been the head.
It was big risk for her, of course, but one does crazy things for love.
Do not fear for your love, my friend.
With a small dedicated group, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.
Let me be blunt.
Nobody knows you're here.
You don't exist.
And unless you cooperate fully, there's nothing I can't do to you.
So why don't you and I start talking?
-Sir.
-Not now.
Moses is on the phone.
Okay.
Trace is running.
Moses.
Here's the thing, Cooper.
With age comes a certain perspective.
I'd be a liar if I said there wasn't a time when I was exactly like you.
Blind ambition.
Misplaced trust.
Why are you telling me this?
(KNOCKlNG ON WlNDOW)
It might help me to decide what to do next.
TECHNlCIAN: Just keep it going. Why?
What are you thinking about?
Our business is a very hard one.
But it was never the killing or the stress, or the bad pay that bothered me.
What was it, Frank?
It's how anything that you love can be taken away from you.
It taught me never to care.
Never to invest.
Then I met this woman.
Sarah.
And now you have her.
Now I can't think of anything more horrible than to know that your enemies can hurt someone that you love.
The feeling is almost indescribable.
You still there, Cooper?
You're at my house.
Almost indescribable, isn't it?
Please.
Please don't hurt my family.
If anything happens to Sarah,
I will rip everything you love out of your life.
And then I'll kill you.
I swear to you, I will keep Sarah safe.
We don't have much time.
Do you understand that?
What are you gonna do, Frank?
I'm gonna kill the Vice President.
What are you gonna do?
OFFlCER: Move! Move!
Mom!
Frank left this for me.
Where did he get it from?
The secure records depository of the ClA.
Look, Sarah.
I know Frank's been right about a few things.
But he's about to cross a line from which there's no turning back.
Right now, you have an opportunity to help him.
You need to tell me everything you know.
Because if I can't stop him,
I'm gonna have to kill him.
Do you know who Frank Moses is?
I mean, really is?
Do you know what he's done?
Wow. You're asking me for help?
That is so lame.
He's gonna eat you for lunch.
She's never gonna trust us.
I can't blame her.
The tip off was a trap.
Someone's got us dancing like marionettes.
Just like Moses called it.
Yeah.
He will take a shot at the V.P.
That's a problem for the Secret Service.
(SCOFFS)
Moses'll take them apart.
Plug me into their detail.
You got it.
What about her?
I'll keep her close.
Protected. Off the grid.
FRANK:
I put a few things away. Just in case.
Frank.
Swedish K.
Now that is exciting.
Explosives?
Just past the RPGs.
I love you, man.
-Make yourself at home.
-The Vice President's gonna love this.
MAN:
Nice to see you, too.
(EXCLAlMS) Thank you.  (BEEPS)
Oh. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Silly. Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you very much. -MARVlN:
You're welcome. Welcome, Ms. Brown.
Mmm-hmm.
It's a pleasure to have you at our Victory Fund Gala.
Oh, I'm so looking forward to it.
Have a lovely night.
Raptor is cleared for entry.
After you, Mr. Vice President.
EMCEE ON MlCROPHONE:
A true war hero, a fabulous friend and a wonderful leader.
And so it's with great pleasure I introduce to you, vice President Robert Stanton.
(CROWD APPLAUDlNG) MAN: I love you, sir!
Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much for being here.
I'm gonna keep this short and sweet so you'll actually write those checks you've been promising.
(ALL LAUGHlNG) Seriously, though, great to see you all.
(INAUDlBLE)
It's the wonderful people here tonight that got us into the White House in the first place. And I believe it's this wonderful group of people who will keep us there for a long, long time!  (CROWD APPLAUDlNG)
I am proud to announce that I will be forming an exploratory committee with the primary goal of seeking a nomination for the Presidency.
(ALL CHEERlNG)
We've had a great journey together.
But I firmly believe that the best is still to come.
God bless you all. God bless America!
(PLAYlNG JAZZ MUSlC) Mmm?  Hello, bunny.
Moves like that could get you killed.
Your radiance tonight renders me almost speechless.
Almost.
What are you grinning at?
I've always dreamed of killing an American President.
Vice President.
Whatever.
Having you in my arms once again, I get carried away.
Really?
Tell me you love me.
It's been a long time, Ivan.
Blink of an eye.
(MUSlC STOPS) (CROWD APPLAUDlNG)
-Ivan.
-Mmm?
The music has stopped.
Is it?
Ah. To work then.  Ivan!
Do you smell that?
-This area is off limits.
-No, it's fine. It's fine.
You'll have to turn around.
No, it's fine. It's all right. I'm sure I'm allowed.
You'll have to go back up, ma'am, or I'll have to treat you as a threat.
Where exactly is the threat?
-STANTON: Good to see you. -(SNlFFlNG)
Gas! I smell gas! Gas!
-(FlRE ALARM RlNGlNG) (ALL EXCLAlMING)  Stand aside.
Primary exit blocked.
Secondary, move.
Move! Move! Move!
WOMAN: Let me out of here! Let me out of here!
Get back up in here to the north stairwell, now!
(HUMMlNG) Ah, yes.  Move to the other limo.
I'll cover you.
(WHlMPERlNG) We have to go.
Now! Now!
WlLLlAM:
Approaching target from the rear.
Outside!
BURBACHER: Secret Service, everybody down!
(KlTCHENWARE CLATTERlNG) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GUNFlRE) Cover us!
We're moving now!
Come on!
Move! Go!
I remember the Secret Service being tougher.
Me, too.
-Okay? -Yeah. Marvin.
Bugger! (GROANS) (GROANlNG)
-Almost there.
-Marvin.
We gotta move.
You're on your own.
I'm no use anymore.
Good luck.
Go on.
Let's move!
Are you hit, sir?
-Are you hit?
-I'm fine!
Just get me the hell out of here.
-Perhaps I could be of assistance?
-(GASPS)
(LAUGHS IN RELlEF) I love you.
I know.
Freeze!
What the... (SCREAMlNG) Go. Go!
Go, go, go!
Stop the car!
Don't you dare stop!
You keep going! Stop the car!
Pull over! I wanna know what the hell that was all about!
(CARS HONKlNG) (WlNDOW SQUEAKlNG)  -Burbacher!
-Get him off! Pull over!
(GRUNTlNG)
Raptor is secure. (GROANS)
(GROANlNG) (STANTON GROANlNG)
Who are you?
One of the men you ordered killed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Guatemala.
I was there.
Well... I'm sure we can negotiate something.
Starting to come back to you now, is it?
If you're looking for revenge...
This is not about revenge.
Are you gonna kill me?
Not just you.
(CELL PHONE RlNGlNG) Yeah?
I'm at the Evanston power plant.
You have 15 minutes to bring me Sarah.
Or I kill the vice President.
He just made contact.
He wants the girl. Evanston Power Station. 15 minutes.
You better alert Secret Service.
CYNTHlA:
Copy that.
Secret Service is en route.
FRANK: All right, come on.
Where's Sarah?
WlLLlAM:
She's on her way.
(COCKlNG GUN)
It's over, Frank.
Any minute the whole world is gonna drop on you.
We'll see.
(CAR APPROACHlNG)
Hey, tough guy.
Surprised to see me?
What the hell's this?
Alex...
Just give him what he wants.
I can't do this anymore.
You ordered these killings, not me.
I don't want to have anything to do with this anymore.
(GASPlNG) You shot me.
Shut up.
I loved watching you being a good guy.
Kicking ass for your country.
It showed a spectacular lack of vision.
The girl goes free.
That'll cost you a gun.
A life for a life.
I tore up all those checks.
I know.
I just wanted to talk to you.
Cooper, cuff him.
Wilkes told me you had promise.
Okay, here's how it goes.
Moses just shot the V.P.
You kill him and the girl, and you're head of the ClA.
CYNTHlA: Cooper.
This is gonna happen either way.
Fuck you, Cynthia.
(CHOKlNG) Thanks.
This gonna be a problem?
No.
I got it...
Grandpa.
(GUNSHOT) Feel better now?
Yeah.
Wanna get pancakes?
Can you believe it?
It all worked out.
Something bad is gonna happen very soon.
Maybe not.
Wait a second.
Nobody's chasing us.
No one's trying to kill us.
I think we just got our lives back.
Almost.
You still owe me a small favor.
Oh, Ivan!
His timing is terrible.
You gave a favor to him?
Just a tiny little nuclear problem in Moldova.
Can we go?
Yes.
We can go.
I told you something bad was gonna happen.
Keep your dress on.
Moldova sucks.
Moldova sucks!
Next time, your girlfriend can wear the dress.
NARRATOR:
Seven brave astronauts are about to launch... ...on the most challenging and risky mission ever flown in space. [CHATTERlNG]
ALTMAN:
It's an interesting emotion when you're sitting there... ...and realizing the clock is ticking.
- All the preparation time is over. - Feel okay, sir?
It's time to go out there and do it.
All right. Okay, good.
MASSlMINO: It's not a foolhardy risk.
It's not roller-skating down Massachusetts Avenue in rush hour.
If there's some risk that goes along with achieving a dream... ...I think it's worth it, and that's what I would wanna tell my kids.
Dreams do come true.
Okay.
McARTHUR: It felt a lot like Christmas morning.
You know, going to get to open your presents.
I got up, big smile on my face.
And marched down to have my breakfast and just really felt great.
Right now the thing I'm looking forward to most... ...is the solid rocket booster ignition.
I wanna get started.
GOOD: I think it was my grandfather that had the most profound influence on me.
He'd bring out the binoculars and he'd teach us about the sky.
No idea that I would be traveling to the stars.
But here I am.
GRUNSFELD:
I go through the mission in my mind, and ask, "Okay... ...what could go wrong?" And I ask myself, "Are we ready to handle that?"
NARRATOR: This is the last chance to save the Hubble Space Telescope.
Here we are, cocooned on our beautiful planet Earth... ...warmed by the light of our nearest star, the sun.
When you see our home like this, you think:
"Out there in all that black space... ...could there be another place like it?
Is there anybody else out there?"
The nearest of those stars is billions of miles away... ...but that hasn't stopped us from exploring them.
Galileo was the first.
Centuries later, we built a truly magical machine... ...the likes of which Galileo could never have imagined.
MAN: Nice and slow.
NARRATOR: The Hubble Space Telescope.
It took more than 10 years and 10,000 people to build.
MAN: Keep coming.
And it would be the first of its kind to be launched into orbit around the Earth.
MAN: Okay, stop. Okay, hold it steady.
NARRATOR: This astronaut crew was chosen to ferry the telescope to space.
Hello, hello, hello.
They launched from the Kennedy Space Center aboard the shuttle Discovery.
MAN [OVER PA]: T-minus 10, go for main engine start.
We are go for main engine start.
T-minus six, five, four... ...three, two, one.
And liftoff.
NARRATOR:
With the sea and clouds of Earth reflecting on its door... ...the great silver bird was released to soar in orbit 320 miles above us.
Soon it would be sending images back to us.
Could we finally unlock the secrets of the universe?
Would we discover other worlds like ours?
The whole world waited for Hubble to open its enormous eye.
Engineers have discovered that the giant telescope has a warped mirror.
One of the mirrors in the Hubble Space Telescope is out of shape, and as a result... ...the pictures it's sending back are no better than those from the ground.
WOMAN: You've got a go to open the doors.
MUSGRAVE: Okay, swinging.
NARRATOR: It would be three long years before astronauts could return... ...with a remedy for the ailing Hubble.
HOFFMAN: I'm not even pulling it, I'm just coaxing it with my fingertips.
AKERS: Pitch, pitch up a little.
NARRATOR:
They installed two instruments... ...each containing a huge contact lens.
Scientists hoped the new lenses would sharpen the telescope's blurry vision.
MAN: Good work, guys.
NARRATOR:
Above the splendor of Africa's Cape of Good Hope... ...Hubble was launched once again.
In the next 10 years, three more astronaut crews... ...would repair and enhance Hubble's vision even further... ...transporting us to places we could only have dreamed about.
In a stream of staggering images... ...Hubble revealed the powerful prolonged aurora on Saturn.
The haunting gaze of a dying star, the Helix Nebula.
The awesome Eagle Nebula, known as the pillars of creation... ...a birthplace of stars.
And the Mice... ...a pair of galaxies twisted and torn by their gravitational dance.
Hubble captured imagery so complex... ...we can actually travel through it.
This is real star travel.
The bright star passing by is Sirius.
It's one of the nearest to Earth, a mere 50 trillion miles away.
We're now heading towards the three little stars in a slanted row there... ...called Orion's Belt.
Distances here are so vast, they're measured in light-years.
A single light-year is almost six trillion miles.
Orion is 1500 light-years away.
That means we're traveling at 150 trillion miles a second.
We're going to explore that rose-colored cloud just below the belt.
It's called the Orion Nebula.
There are amazing things happening inside these clouds.
As we look through Hubble's eye... ...we're getting to see them as never before.
We're descending into a gargantuan canyon of clouds.
It's 90 trillion miles across.
It's a star nursery.
The biggest of the young stars are right in the center of the nursery.
Their energy creates unbelievably strong winds... ...howling down this vast canyon at five million miles an hour.
The winds have blasted out a huge bowl-shaped cavity... ...in the side of the cloud facing the Earth... ...giving Hubble and us... ...a window on the secret life of the stars inside.
The biggest star here is surrounded by a flock of baby stars... ...each nested in its own cocoon.
The wind from the giant star is blowing so hard against these little ones... ...it creates shock waves on their near sides, and long tails behind.
That's why astronomers have nicknamed these strange objects "tadpoles."
Inside each cocoon is an infant solar system.
These tadpoles might turn into full-grown solar systems one day... ...but the continuous blast of wind may stunt their growth.
But tucked away in a calmer part of Orion's nursery... ...Hubble has found confirmation... ...that planets are forming around other stars.
Our own solar system may have looked just like this... ...when the sun had formed, but the Earth did not yet exist.
Perhaps this is how we and our own world began.
The once-ailing Hubble Space Telescope... ...offered its greatest performance yet... ...a glimpse of time and space astronomers had previously only dreamed about.
But for the Hubble, time is running out... ...amid new concerns about safety in space.
NARRATOR: In early 2003, the tragic loss ofspace shuttle Columbia... ...forced NASA to rethink its program.
MALE ANNOUNCER: NASA has canceled Hubble's final service mission.
In Washington, Senator Barbara Mikulski led the charge to review the decision... ...questioning NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe's January claim... ...that keeping Hubble alive wasn't worth the cost or the risk.
Hubble is not a piece of techno-junk that's creaky, tattered and worn.
If we do nothing, then within about two years... ...either its gyroscopes or its batteries will die... ...and it'll tumble out of control.
NARRATOR: But flight designers came up with a daring plan to reduce the risk.
If the shuttle was damaged during launch... ...another one could come up and rescue the stranded crew.
They could shimmy from one to the other down the arm, fireman style.
We'll let them try it first.
We are going to add a shuttle servicing mission... ...to the Hubble Space Telescope, to the shuttle's manifest... ...to be flown before it retires.
[APPLAUSE]
NARRATOR:
The final mission is a go... ...and for the first time, a second orbiter stands ready... ...in case there's a call for help.
Just weeks to launch, the Hubble crew is training hard. [INDlSTlNCT CHATTER]
The spacewalkers practice in this six million gallon pool... ...at the Johnson Space Center.
It's the closest they can get to zero gravity.
McARTHUR: Motion is stopped for the stanchion.
GOOD: Okay.
NARRATOR:
Four stories underwater... ...there's an entire shuttle cargo bay and a life-size model of Hubble.
MASSlMINO:
A big thing about this telescope... ...is it can point really, really accurately... ...and hold its position, and it's the gyros that allow you to do that.
But they're in a tough spot.
MASSlMINO: Got them? GOOD:
MASSlMINO: I'm gonna move in a little bit.
GOOD:
We'll stick Mass, my spacewalking partner... ...up inside the telescope, in the bowels of the science instruments.
MASSlMINO: We gotta be really careful around them.
And I'm a big goon and I've gotta get inside of there.
So this is the problem, how to get me inside of this really cramped place.
GOOD: He's gotta work in there, but he has to be perfectly still.
And he can only work with one hand... ...right there amongst the fixed-head star trackers.
They don't like to be bumped.
And, you know... ...you knock them off their axes and they're useless.
Then the whole telescope's useless. [INDlSTlNCT CHATTER]
NARRATOR:
Mike Massimino... ...otherwise known as Mass, has serviced Hubble once before.
- Got it. - Fun today?
NARRATOR: John Grunsfeld, on the left, is an astrophysicist and mountaineer.
He's had more visits to Hubble than anyone else.
Boy, are we having fun this time?
NARRATOR: This'll be the first trip to space for Mike Good, known as Bueno.
He enjoys a slightly soggy hug from his wife Joan.
Soon they'll be saying their goodbyes to families and friends. [INDlSTlNCT CHATTER]
Shuttle arm operator Megan McArthur describes the last hours before launch.
McARTHUR:
I always loved being by the ocean... ...surrounded by dunes and, you know, seaside plants.
It's very calming for me, down at Kennedy.
And it's just a nice place to go kind of relax... ...and let your mind wander a little bit... ...and relieve you from the different cares about getting ready to launch.
NARRATOR: Launch day is finally here.
It's no secret that space is a dangerous place.
In the last two decades, 32 astronauts have put their own lives on the line... ...to give life to Hubble.
Each one of these men and women is a true hero.
NASA TECH [OVER PA]: T-minus five minutes and counting. WOMAN 1:
Go for orbiter APU start. WOMAN 2: PLT, perform APU start.
MAN 1: OTC, PLT and mark.
WOMAN 3: SRO.
MAN 2: SRO is go.
- You have a range clear to launch. WOMAN 3: And CDR.
ALTMAN: CDR and entire crew is go.
MAN 3: Okay, Scooter. Look, it's a great day to go fly.
On behalf of the KSC processing and launch team I'd like to wish you, your crew... ...and the Hubble Space Telescope team a great mission.
We'll see you back here in about 11 days. Enjoy the ride, pal.
NASA TECH [OVER PA]: Nozzle check of the SRBs, firing chain is armed.
Sound suppression water system armed.
T-minus 10, nine... ...eight, seven... ...six, five... ...four, three... ...two, one.
And liftoff of space shuttle Atlantis! [ALL CHEERlNG]
Atlantis on its way, all three engines now throttling down... ...as the vehicle passes through the area of maximum dynamic pressure.
Atlantis, go at throttle up.
ALTMAN: Houston, Atlantis copies. Go at throttle.
NASA TECH [OVER PA]:
Approaching staging... ...the burnout of the twin solid rocket boosters.
Thrust tailing off and SRBs standing by for separation. [CROWD APPLAUDlNG]
Separation confirmed.
Phenomenal first stage performance.
Atlantis is continuing in its due easterly course... ...to catch up with the Hubble Space Telescope one last time.
GRUNSFELD: Hey Ray J, welcome to orbit. - It's great to be here, Doug.
GRUNSFELD: How was that ride? - It was wild, basically.
FEUSTEL: I like this floating in space. [CREW LAUGHlNG]
- You have something in here? MASSlMINO: My food is in my stomach.
- Best place to store food is your stomach. - Mine was there temporarily.
- Now it's in my tummy. - Well, hopefully it stays there.
You don't really shower. You wet a washcloth with this.
This is our water-wetter thing. It's kind of like a garden hose.
Let me show you how it works here.
All I can tell you about going to the bathroom in space is suction.
FEUSTEL: Hey, John. - Hey, Drew.
- What's going on? - Not too much, what you doing?
- Hanging around. - What are you, a bat?
Nope, just a spacewalker.
GRUNSFELD: Those tears on the shield shell were--
NARRATOR: Day three. Their first task is to capture Hubble.
ALTMAN: The rendezvous is basically us finding the telescope.
Now it's doing 17,500 miles an hour... ...so by the time we get right next to it... ...we're doing the same thing.
That's the tense part, are we going the right speed?
To make things even harder... ...in orbit the sun rises and sets every 90 minutes.
MASSlMINO: .03, I see you slowing down.
ALTMAN:
Till we can finally come up right underneath the telescope... ...with it floating just inches away from the aft window... ...so that Megan can reach out with the arm and grapple it.
MASSlMINO: Still 0.03 over the pin. McARTHUR:
MASSlMINO: Keep coming. ALTMAN:
MASSlMINO: I see halfway down. ALTMAN:
McARTHUR: Trigger.
MASSlMINO: Timer. McARTHUR:
MASSlMINO: Close and capture. McARTHUR:
MASSlMINO: Congratulations. Awesome job.
ALTMAN: Houston, Atlantis, Hubble has arrived on board Atlantis.
NASA GROUND COM: Atlantis, Houston, we copy.
Nice job, Megan... ...it's great to be back with the telescope.
McARTHUR:
Once we have the telescope hovering over the latches... ...the idea is to just bring it straight down... ...slow enough so that if we did perhaps tap into the latches at all... ...that no damage would be done.
NARRATOR:
This last mission to repair it... ...will be the most challenging and difficult of all.
These are our EVA, that means spacewalking... ...tool caddies, called mini workstations.
They have our tethers on them so we don't lose things. We can tether to stuff.
MASSlMINO: You always gotta have that on you.
FEUSTEL: You gotta have these on.
MASSlMINO: Drew? FEUSTEL:
MASSlMINO: This is your first spacewalk tomorrow.
What do you feel? What do you think?
- I'm excited. I'm getting excited. - You're ready.
Seeing Hubble come into the payload bay was pretty amazing.
The rendezvous was fun and now we're ready to go.
I'm looking forward to putting in the Wide Field Camera.
- What's Wide Field gonna do? - Unlock the secrets to the universe.
MASSlMINO: That's right. - Unlock more secrets of the universe.
- That's right. MASSlMINO: Right.
Getting dressed the day of a spacewalk, you know, it's very hard... ...just like a little kid going out in the snow... ...to get all those clothes on.
One of the last things you wanna do... ...because once your helmet goes on, you can't touch your face any longer, is scratch.
GRUNSFELD: Ah, what a beautiful view.
MASSlMINO: It's just a wondrous sight to see our planet in its entirety.
It's a gift that astronauts have been given.
NARRATOR: Day four: the installation of the critical Wide Field Camera.
Right off the bat, trouble for John and Drew.
One stuck bolt.
ALTMAN: The start of the spacewalk had been a little bit delayed.
We were kind of up against the clock to begin with.
And then running into that bolt.
I'm thinking, you know, "We are right at the edge here.
Our number-one science objective would be out the window on the first spacewalk."
GRUNSFELD: First roller's going in. Bring your down-- End down slightly.
NARRATOR: With a lot of perseverance, the Wide Field Camera is finally installed.
GRUNSFELD: Okay, that's good.
NARRATOR:
Day five brings the delicate task... ...of replacing the three Rate Sensor Units... ...known as RSUs.
If you're gonna be an astronaut, you gotta get used to the acronyms.
Tiny cameras inside the spacewalkers' helmets... ...give us a unique over-shoulder view as they work.
The new RSU is attached to a giant toothpick called a pick stick.
Very carefully, Bueno guides it into position.
One bump against the star tracker could cripple the telescope forever.
One down, two more to go.
For the next one, Mass goes in backwards.
GOOD: Okay, your feet are on the boot plate here, left foot a little bit left.
- Okay, so, I'll take your right foot in first. MASSlMINO: Okay.
GOOD: Right toe's coming in.
Uh-- Heel inboard.
MASSlMINO: Okay.
NARRATOR: By nightfall, they're in trouble.
GOOD: Anything sticking out the back of that?
MASSlMINO: I don't know.
NARRATOR: This RSU just will not go in.
MASSlMINO: Coming off the plate.
GOOD: Doesn't feel seated.
MASSlMINO: I don't think it is.
GOOD: I'm hitting something on the bottom right now. I can't come down anymore.
MASSlMINO: See if you can drive it, it might work.
Now go left a little bit, just little, little, little.
Little bit more, little bit more right. Little more, roll right.
Okay, now come, come in.
NARRATOR:
After hours of exhausting attempts... ...in minus 200 degree temperatures....
GOOD: I've definitely got it. GRUNSFELD:
MASSlMINO: Yeah, that bolt is in. NARRATOR:
MASSlMINO: Great job, Mike.
GRUNSFELD: Houston, Atlantis. We're ecstatically able to report...
- ...the RSU-3R connectors are mated. CREW: Whoo!
NASA GROUND COM: Copy that and nice job by all.
JOHNSON: Okay, Mass, Bueno. EVA-2, what do you think?
- It was like-- Go ahead. - No, go, you go.
It was like a heavyweight fight. Oh, my gosh.
RSUs, you love them?
- I love them now that they're over. - Love them to death!
- It's a good one to have behind us. McARTHUR: What name would you give...
- ...the three RSUs? - Larry, Curly and Moe!
MASSlMINO: Okay, you guys know the drill, let's remove COSTAR.
McARTHUR: Coming out slow.
MASSlMINO:
We use lots of tethers... ...tethers for everything, because stuff in space floats.
You don't wanna lose your stuff. And you don't wanna lose yourself either.
FEUSTEL: This is a lot tighter than-- Heh.
COSTAR's, I think, the tightest instrument.
MASSlMINO: We're really dependent on our spacesuit to keep us alive.
We don't wanna get a rip or a tear in our suit... ...because outside of our spacesuit is space, and in space there's no air.
There's nothing to keep us alive.
And the part of our suit that's most vulnerable is our gloves.
MASSlMINO: Drew, I have a warning for you.
There's a possible finger pinch hazard... ...when you're stowing COSTAR in the aft fixture, so be careful.
FEUSTEL: Thanks, Mike. MASSlMINO:
It's not quite Barneys New York.
It's good, but it doesn't come with its own restroom or cafeteria.
FEUSTEL: Continue down.
McARTHUR: Copy, continuing down.
FEUSTEL: Top down, and left.
Well, I just finished shooting an IMAX scene... ...and so I'm done with that.
So I wanna get a little exercise in... ...before I shoot my next scene... ...so this is a little stress relief here on the middeck.
NARRATOR: Most of Hubble's instruments were designed for repair in space.
But not the Advanced Camera for Surveys.
When its power supply failed... ...the only hope was to remove and replace fragile circuit boards inside the camera.
They were held captive by dozens of tiny screws.
For John and Drew, it's like performing brain surgery with oven mitts.
GRUNSFELD: It takes all the focus I can muster.
I have 32 tiny screws to remove.
- Number 3 is out. GOOD: Copy, Number 3.
GRUNSFELD:
And so I have a Zen approach to doing the task... ...where I only think about the one specific task that I'm doing, the one specific screw.
And when that screw's out, I move to the next screw.
Number 5 is out.
Okay, copy.
GRUNSFELD: And eventually I'll get to the last one, and then I'll be done.
There's no point thinking about how many screws I have ahead... ...or how many I've completed, it'll just be the one screw.
- Number 11 is out. GOOD: Copy, 11.
NARRATOR: Removing the razor-sharp circuit boards is a dangerous business.
GRUNSFELD:
We learned what to avoid touching... ...because if you make a significant cut in your glove through the bladder... ...the oxygen will leak out of your suit and you will die.
- Card 1 is out. GOOD: That looks great, John.
GRUNSFELD:
Somehow I don't think brain surgeons... ...go, "Yahoo!" when they pull something out.
ALTMAN:
When they came in, they were tired, they were exhausted, thirsty... ...but they were getting out of their suits with a sense of accomplishment.
Now the sad news was that once they relaxed for... ...oh, about five seconds... ...we had to put them back to work getting everything ready for the next day.
MASSlMINO: Drew, what are you doing? - I'm using the tape.
MASSlMINO: Is there a reason why you have sunglasses on in the middeck...
- ...where there's no sun? - They look cool.
MASSlMINO: Ah. That's my man.
NARRATOR: On day seven, Mass and Bueno run into a big problem.
MASSlMINO: Doesn't look good, Drew.
Before we can do any of this, all this fancy stuff... ...we had to get off this big handrail that was in the way.
I don't think it's coming out.
It was a night pass.
It was dark out... ...which added to the trauma. It seemed kind of cold and lonely out there.
I couldn't wake up out of this nightmare that was occurring.
NARRATOR:
After hours of failed attempts... ...the flight controllers finally tell them, "Just break it off."
GRUNSFELD: Think we're gonna be able to get this, Drew?
I do actually.
I think once he busts off the handrail... ...the rest is gonna go smooth as silk.
FEUSTEL: Okay, Mass. MASSlMINO:
MASSlMINO: It's off!
GOOD: Easy, easy, Mike. Just real easy, okay?
MASSlMINO: There we go. - I got it.
FEUSTEL: Looked like it all stayed intact with the tape.
MASSlMINO: Yeah, it did. I don't think we even scattered any debris.
- I see STlS in front of me. FEUSTEL: Awesome.
MASSlMINO: Now there's lots of planets out there in other solar systems.
One of the cool things about STlS is it can analyze the atmospheres of those planets.
What everybody's hoping is maybe we find something similar... ...to what we have here on Earth.
And then we hit the jackpot.
Guess what, it fits.
FEUSTEL: That's awesome.
NARRATOR: For Drew, it's one more spacewalk to go.
GRUNSFELD: And Mass, I do have a tether.
FEUSTEL: In case it floats away.
NARRATOR: He and John are replacing a Fine Guidance Sensor.
When it's locked on a target... ...it will be like holding a laser beam steady on a dime...
- ...that's 200 miles away. GRUNSFELD: Is the mirror clean?
FEUSTEL: Oh, yeah, the mirror's clean. It's very clean.
GRUNSFELD: What?
FEUSTEL: This is an amazing view of Hawaii.
NARRATOR: It has been said that in the process of going to the moon... ...we discovered Earth.
Seeing it from here, you experience a new appreciation... ...for the perfect utopia we inhabit.
FEUSTEL: Fantastic!
NARRATOR:
In all our searching, we have yet to find another planet... ...that could nourish and protect us as it does.
In our future journeys away from our sheltering Earth... ...we'll need all the amazing skills and teamwork of this crew.
The same courage and inventiveness that has restored Hubble... ...to its full capacity and beyond.
MASSlMINO: Now it's time for our favorite segment:
Scooter's Corner.
- He's actually in his real corner. - This is my seat--
- Wait, I've got gum. - What are you gonna do with that?
I put it under the dash. Maybe the next guy can enjoy it.
- There you have it. - You know, I was afraid I'd say:
"Bye, Hubble. Waah."
But no, you know, we did it.
- Oh, one more thing. - Yes.
Steve Lindsey, I was just kidding about the gum.
Don't eat it, you might get sick. Never know who's been there.
NARRATOR: On day nine, above the Sahara, the crew returns the telescope to orbit.
They'll return safely home to their families... ...knowing they've exceeded every expectation.
GRUNSFELD:
When we look back 500 years from now... ...I believe that Hubble will be judged... ...one of the truly remarkable inventions of humankind.
Hubble addresses such fundamental questions:
How did planets form? Where did we come from?
Where did the universe come from?
How did the pieces... ...the chemical elements that we're made of, form?
All these things that allowed us to be here, to build a Hubble... ...to look out into the cosmos.
NARRATOR: And already, what wonders we now see.
The new Wide Field Camera captures a huge pillar of newborn stars... ...in the Carina Nebula.
The infant stars here are hidden... ...but Hubble's new infrared eye can peer through the veil of gas and dust... ...revealing for the first time a magical treasure trove of young stars.
An exquisite butterfly signals the spectacular death of a star.
Its wings are boiling caldrons of gas... ...spewing out at 600,000 miles an hour... ...from the dying star at its heart.
Millions of stars at a glance... ...in Omega Centauri.
Our eyes see only the middle-aged white stars, like our sun.
But in a single combined infrared and ultraviolet view... ...the new Wide Field shows us the extreme temperatures of stars.
We know that older stars become cooler, ballooning into red giants.
Intensely hot stars... ...some burning the last of their fuel before they die, shine bright blue.
All the stars we see in our night sky... ...are but a tiny handful of a few hundred billion stars in our galaxy.
This giant disk of stars, gas and dust... ...is our home in the universe.
We call it the Milky Way.
Our nearest neighbor is some two and a half million light-years away.
It's another spiral galaxy named Andromeda.
We're the largest members of our local group... ...of about three dozen galaxies.
Yet our small group is like a village, far from the bright lights of the big city.
In the distance is a metropolis called the Virgo Cluster.
It glows with the light of over 2000 galaxies... ...of every shape and size.
In the center of the Virgo Cluster... ...is a giant elliptical galaxy called Messier 87... ...perhaps 10 times the size of our Milky Way.
At its heart is a super-massive black hole... ...spewing a jet of high-energy radiation... ...huge distances across the galaxy.
Virgo's collection of 2000... ...is but a small drop in an ocean of galaxies.
Hubble is now peering deeply into a tiny region of the sky... ...looking back across time towards the very edge of the observable universe.
The further back we travel in time... ...the more misshapen and less developed the galaxies appear.
The objects we're now seeing... ...are 10 billion light-years away.
Their light began to cross the universe towards us... ...billions of years before the Earth existed.
From this small sliver of a view... ...astronomers estimate... ...there may be a hundred billion galaxies across the universe.
Immense strings of galaxies crisscross the cosmos... ...collecting into vast clusters and super-clusters... ...where the strings intersect.
On the largest scale, the structure resembles a cosmic web of galaxies... ...spanning the universe.
Billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars.
Doesn't it make you wonder?
Will we ever find anywhere as perfect as our own planet Earth?
Hubble has given us a renewed perspective on the place we call home.
We now know how important it is to protect this fragile oasis... ...deep within the boundless reaches of Hubble's magnificent universe.

Has Garrett called you about Ian's messenger?
Not a sound. Guys, we dragged Garrett into this.
We just gotta trust him.
We're trusting him with Ian's $10,000, and I could've used some of that to replace Melissa's ring.
And if they traced the money from Ian to you?
How would you explain that? I just don't like waiting.

No, just a little surprised, I guess.
You sent Mrs. Dilaurentis a note?
Yes, after the fashion show.
That's why you invited him, because of what happened?

He's registered at Hollis college, but no one's seen him in class for a week.
He's been crashing with a buddy, but, uh, buddy says he's gone.
Gone.
This guy can't stay underwater for long.
We'll find him.
If I hear anything, I'll call you, okay?
Okay.
But, uh, Spencer, don't expect to find any surprises here.
All these loose ends, they're all gonna lead back to the same place.
Ian.
Ashley: I had a feeling you would call.
Did Hanna say anything about what happened at the fashion show?
I didn't press her on it.
What do you think that was?
Well, you know about mean girls.
They had 'em when we were in school.
Not like this, we didn't.
No, not like this.
And I don't think this just started.
I think it's been going on for a while, and we're just now noticing it.
I think you're right.
- You do? - Alison?
Hanna being hit by that car?
Ian in the bell tower, everything else?
It's easy to get paranoid, start seeing connections where there aren't any connections.
I just knew if I didn't speak to another parent about this, my head was going to explode.
Who else have you talked to?
Well, Emily's mom is in Texas, and I didn't really want to do this over the phone.
The Hastings?
I'll tell you one thing.
I think we rolled over way too quickly on that therapist deal, separating the girls?
I am not gonna do that again.
It seemed to make sense at the time.
That was about helping anyone.
That was about Peter Hastings.
Never met a problem he couldn't buy off, one way or the other.
What have you got there?
Oh, I was just clearing the Ivy, and...
Where was this?
Right here, about half a foot down on the property line.
I'll take care of it.
What is it?
Nothing to worry about.
Why would somebody bury it?
It's all right, Toby.
- I said I'll take care of it.
- Okay. Elliot: Is everything okay?
Has he noticed we're gone?
Does he... looks anxious at all?
- Thanks, Byron. - Thought you were kidding.
No kidding.
I may have carried the baby for nine months, but Elliott's planning to carry him straight through college.
If you ever need a sitter, you should call me.
- I'd love to do it. - That'd be great!
Just stop by the house with a blood sample.
The background check won't take more than an hour.
Hey, where's Mike?
Well, he promised he'd be here, so...
Uh, yeah, he's on his own clock.
You'll find out about that soon enough.
( Doorbell ringing ) Hello.  So glad you could make it.
Thank you for inviting me.
- Thank you.
- For you. Aria.  Hi, Ezra.
I'll put these in some water.
Ezra! Hey.
Byron.
A gift for the host. Whoa, this is serious scotch.
Well, always works for me.
- Uh, Byron? Help?
- Excuse me. Isn't that the scotch you said tasted
like diet cola and iodine?
Yes, until I asked the guy at the liquor store what your dad liked.
This is Nancy Partha.
This is Ezra. Hi, Ezra Fitz.
Nice to meet you.
Good to see you, Elliott.
( Doorbell ringing ) Hey. Come in.
Sorry I'm late.
Uh, no, it's fine.
Thanks.
- A hockey stick?
- Part of one.
It was snapped off at the handle, and the blade was splintered,
like somebody used it to hit something hard.
And it was buried?
I thought it was some old junk,
- until your dad saw it.
- What did he say? At first, I thought he was angry.
Now I think he might've been scared.
It was white and blue.
Those are rosewood colors.
There was a piece of tape on what was left of the handle.
It had "Hastings" written on it. Was that yours or Melissa's?
It's just an old practice stick I use sometimes.
- It was Melissa's.
- It'll do. No, it's like this.
Oh.
Ali, when did you become so interested in field hockey?
I'm not.
Yet.
I'm just considering my options.
Oh!
Maybe you're interested in someone who's interested in field hockey?
Boys don't play field hockey.
You don't have to play the game to be interested.
That's the same stick that Toby found buried behind my house.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely the same one. How did it get in your backyard?
Well, you don't bury old sporting equipment, but... you do bury murder weapons.
Are you serious?
It was in Ali's bedroom the summer she was killed.
Anybody could've used it.
Anybody?
Jason: Alison.
Mom wants you.
- Why? - I don't know.
She didn't say why, okay? Just go.
I got better things to do than hunt you down.
- Like what? - What's this for?
- It's for me. - Oh, yeah?
- Give it back.
- Oh, yeah? - Give it back, Jason.
- Or what? ( Gasps ) Be careful!
Ooh!
Too bad.
You're not gonna get a second chance, Ali.
Jason was in the house that summer.
- But so was Ian.
- Yeah, but Jason is the one who says he can't remember the night Ali disappeared, and I'm starting to think that is awfully convenient.
Spencer, look, this could just be "A" playing with us again.
Except that we didn't find this.
Somebody else did, and if my dad hadn't stopped Jason from building that fence, no one ever would've found it.
What's your dad saying about this?
I haven't spoken to him yet.
He's in a meeting. He won't be home till late.
Ella: Aria!
Hey, I gotta go.
Aria, think about this.
Think about what this means.
I'll think about it.
Bye. Em, you don't have to go to the library.
It won't bother me if you study here.
All due respect, studying here is like studying at the mall.
I study at the mall all the time.
Yeah, well, I'm different.
Is this a gay thing?
No, it's a brain thing.
Hello. Hello.
Good-bye.
Was it something I said?
She's just so studious, that's all.
Your mom home?
No, she's out to dinner with my dad.
Oh. What's that mean?
It means...
"Oh." Ezra:
I was either going to Japan or Europe.
I ended up biking through Connor Pass on my way to Kerry.
So, why did you pick Ireland?
I love Joyce and Beckett.
I wanted to see where they started.
Byron: And you did it by bike?
That's great. I've got a bike in my garage.
Every morning it mocks me.
Oh, you'll get back on it.
Just have to add a baby seat.
- You cycle? - Uh, some, yeah.
When I first took off from college, I did the Kona coast.
That's where they have the triathlon, right? Yeah, I wanted to clear my head before I came back here.
Riding those lava fields is like being on the moon, you know?
That's intense.
Yeah, it's what I needed.
( Doorbell ringing ) - Aria.
- Hi. Are your parents home?
Mom?
Dad? - Hi, Barry.
- Sorry to interrupt, but it's about Mike.
He's okay, but we have a situation.
What kind of situation?
Looks like he broke into a house.
- Byron: He what?
- Over on Morrison. Ella: There's gotta be some kind of mistake.
I'm afraid not. It's Mike.
He must've thought the place was empty.
Homeowner grabbed him and called us.
He's at the station now.
If I could get you to come down there...
Yes, of course.
Do you want to stay here? No, no, we'll both go.
Aria. Aria, please stay here.
Yeah.
Peter: Toby.
Hey.
Glad I caught you. I wanted to talk to you about today.
Is this about the hockey stick?
I thought it was junk from the DiLaurentis's yard.
I have a real problem with them. It said "Hastings" on the stick.
Yeah, I realized that.
I also realized it might've looked a little strange, my taking it that way.
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.
It was nothing.
Um, you know, in fact, if you talk with Spencer, don't bother mentioning it to her, okay?
Too late.
You told her.
Didn't know I shouldn't.
What'd she say?
It didn't seem to mean anything to her.
There's no point in telling her about this conversation, is there?
No, sir.
Good night, Toby.
Thanks for all the hard work.
Good night, Mr. Hastings.
- Hey, I got this.
- No, no. I kind of just want to keep moving.
Okay.
The Parthas took that salad, right?
Yeah, they just wanted to go home.
Separation anxiety.
Not the anticipated evening, was it?
No.
You were doing really well.
I was, wasn't I?
Yeah.
Do you practice much at home?
Oh, just the initial hellos and smile. So, uh, who's Jason?
- He's Ali's brother.
- No, I know that.
I just didn't know he was friends of the family. Yeah, my mom and his mom are friends.
Oh.
I'm gonna go see if he wants more coffee.
Great, I'll run the dishwasher.
Okay.
You want some more?
Sure, a little.
Mike promised me he wouldn't do this anymore.
He probably meant it when he said it.
Give me that.
Sit down. Take a breath.
He must be so angry at me.
Why would Mike be angry at you?
Because...
We're in the middle of this mess with Ian and mom and dad.
If it weren't for me, he probably would've gotten more attention from my parents.
No, no, no.
Trust me, you're not the reason Mike is doing this.
How do you know that?
I know a lot about misplaced guilt.
Look, the amount of trouble Mike's in depends on how many times he's done this.
Do you have any idea how many places he's broken into?
( Indistinct ) Mike.  - Mike!
- Mike, wait.
I don't want to talk about it.
You don't want to talk about it, but you are going to talk about it.
How was the dinner party?
It was fine, till the cops showed up to let us know that our son had been arrested for breaking and entering.
Byron.
Get in the car.
You're angry.
And you're not?
Oh, no, I'm angry, but more importantly, how did we miss this?
I don't even know what "this" is.
Well, he's not a criminal, so it's gotta be about something else.
What could he possibly be walking around with that he couldn't talk to us about?
I don't know, but maybe we need to do a better job asking.
( Sighs ) ( Sighs )  So, you teach at Hollis.
Yes.
Is that how you know Professor Montgomery?
Yes, and I taught with Ella at Rosewood High this year.
Did you have Aria?
In any of your classes.
Yes, I did.
I was just thinking you should go now.
What, the both of us?
Yes, please.
Are you sure?
My parents are going to be home with Mike any second, and it's probably a good idea that he doesn't have to deal with anyone but family right now.
Okay.
Do you want us to help finish cleaning up?
No, I'm good, really.
- Let me know how your brother's doing.
- I'll call. We'll talk tomorrow?
Yes, absolutely.
Thanks. I'm sorry. - Good night.
- Good night. Buy it now and save some money.
You're gonna want it next week, and I can't guarantee that price.
Don't start.
I'm not trying to change you.
Then you shouldn't push me on this stuff.
I'm not pushing, I'm suggesting.
What, that I should be frying burgers for minimum wage?
I'm just saying I see you doing this sketchy stuff and I worry about you.
What I'm doing now is legit compared to other stuff. What's that supposed to mean?
It means you already know more about me than anybody else, so why can't we just keep it where it is?
All right.
So, where do you come down on the whole natural versus synthetic extensions debate?
I mean, does affordability and easy maintenance really outweigh the look and feel of real human hair?
Okay.
( Sighs ) Two years ago, I was living in Allentown, and there were these guys...
Actual bad guys.
They stole cars on order.
I did some work for them...
Hacking into the DMV,
laundering VlN numbers.
Nobody got hurt, but it was just a matter of time, so I got out.
And these guys were really not happy about it.
Before they could figure out what to do, I was gone.
So, trust me, I know the difference between sketchy and criminal.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...
Maybe you should tell the cops.
There's a difference between being honest and being suicidal.
You've never told anyone this, have you?
No.
I haven't.
And I'd appreciate you keeping it to yourself. Cross my heart.
- No.
- Spencer, go upstairs. - Please.
- Spencer... - Please. - Let go!
Stop.
Let go! Stop it. You can't burn that.
I can do whatever I want with junk I find on my property.
But it could be evidence.
We don't need more evidence now that Ian Thomas is in a grave I paid for.
Please, try to understand.
I'm tired, Spencer.
Your mother is tired.
And I'm not taking the chance of more questions over some damn piece of wood.
This is over.
No more questions.
It could be important. Important?
Like the trophy you found?
I-I didn't put that in the yard.
It doesn't matter who put it there or why.
It doesn't mean anything. It's nothing.
It doesn't exist.
I told him it didn't mean anything to you.
I'm sorry you had to lie.
No, it doesn't matter.
When I came down the stairs and I saw what he was doing, I thought,
"Oh, my God, he thinks I killed her."
No, he couldn't think that. Nobody could.
He didn't.
He thought it was a prop.
He thought it was something that I just made up just to cause trouble and be the center of attention.
That's all he sees when he looks at me.
That's all he's ever gonna see until we find out what happened.
Well, then, we'll have to find out.
Ali got up and walked away.
And then somewhere between the kissing rock and her backyard, somebody hit her.
Now you're thinking they hit her with your hockey stick?
The paper said that it was blunt force trauma, but they don't say what was used.
That's the stuff they never give you in newspapers.
The police hold back details so they won't have to deal with a lot of crackpots.
You think they know what was used?
Cops always know more than they tell. He's never told anyone, but he told me.
Because he trusts you.
You think so?
Yes.
So, you don't mind that I tell you he told me this thing, but I can't tell you what it is?
I don't mind. I've got all the secrets I need right now. Look, it'll be okay, Em.
You'll do great this year, and Danby will offer you a scholarship, and your folks will never find out.
We'll make sure of it.
I'm glad I'm here.
So am I.
And I'm glad Caleb came back for you.
Yeah.
He came back for me. ( Door opens ) ( Ashley and Tom giggling )  Shh!
( Whispering ) ( Giggling ) Shh.
Is your dad getting back with your mom?
( Sighs ) You promised.
Stay out of my room.
Uhh!
You took things from Emily.
You broke into Spencer's house.
You stole from a blind girl! No, I didn't.
This is from Jenna Marshall's.
She makes these. I don't care what she makes.
I didn't break into that house.
That candle thing comes from an apartment over a garage on Willoughby.
- Whose apartment? - Officer "mcfriendly". Garrett Reynolds?
I was looking for maybe a gun or something I could use to get away from here.
He's a cop, and he's got crap like that in his place.
No, you're wrong.
I thought it might be worth a couple of bucks, so I took it.
And a camera and a GPS. This has to be from Jenna Marshall's.
I know what I stole, and I know where I stole it from.
I got that from Garrett Reynolds' apartment.
( Radio chatter ) There you go.
Thanks for letting me see you.
It sounded important when you called. I have to ask you something.
Do the police know what kind of weapon the killer used on Alison?
They never found the murder weapon, Spencer, you know that.
But do they know what it might've been?
It would all be in the coroner's report.
They can tell a lot about a weapon by the kind of wound it leaves.
So, in the report it would say what she was hit with,
like, how big, how hard, how sharp, if it was a man or a woman that used it.
Spencer, slow down.
It's like I said before.
All of these loose ends, they're not gonna change the main fact:
It was Ian, and he's gone. ( Sighs )
You need to take that in.
Ali's killer is dead. I'm not so sure.
Why not?
L-31, are you still code seven?
- ( Message tone beeps )
L-35 is requesting a code eight... ♪
I can roll if he needs me. - Over.
- Disregard... Roger that.
All right.
If it wasn't Ian, who do you think killed Ali?

Confirming targets.
GRANT: We've got you.
Target one confirmed. Move in.
GRANT: (OVER RADlO) I repeat, target one confirmed.
(WHlSPERlNG) What the fuck is going on?
I'm standing out like a dildo in Disneyland.
STONEBRlDGE: (OVER RADlO) Hold your position. Sierra one, camera up.
We see you.
STONEBRlDGE: Target one is approaching.
GRANT: Target one, Beruti Lefu. South African national.
Middle-ranking underworld player.
Seen here with a known contact of... Latif.
SCOTT: (ON RADlO) Okay, got eyes on the "Three Stooges."
Looks like they got to where they're going.
He's hired muscle and he's on the move.
I want you up there.
I want to know what he's carrying.
But, most of all, I want to know who he's meeting.
GRANT: Status?
Sierra in position.
Kilo in position.
Delta in position. Hey, who are you talking to?
STONEBRlDGE: All right, let's move in three...two...
Who are you talking to?
No one, buddy, no one. Just keep cooking, huh?
What the hell is that? Who are you talking to?
SCOTT: Not now, buddy, not now, huh?
What the fuck?
MAN: Who are you talking to? God!
(LAUGHlNG) (LAUGHlNG) You're talking to God?
That's fucking funny, huh?

Hey, God, the American is talking to God!
Hey, shh, shh... Come on.
Shoosh? Yeah.
(LAUGHS) Ahh! Ahh!
Do you hear that?
Yeah, let's go!

Fuck!
Fuck!
STONEBRlDGE: Stop! Put the gun down!
STONEBRlDGE: Shit.

Cape town... (REPORTER CONTlNUES REPORTlNG THE WEATHER)
GUARD 1: Are we good to go, Viho?
(LAUGHS) Yep. Let's hit the road.
GUARD: All doors locked, sealed, and secured.
Unit 71, travelling.
Okay, you are free to go.
Roll, Jedi.
MARSHALL: You'd better hope he talks.
STONEBRlDGE:
If I hadn't taken him out, he would've killed you.
He only got that chance because of you.
I don't need you rushing to my assistance, Sergeant.
Okay.
You end up killing two of the men we're supposed to bring in.
Threatening our only lead to Latif.
MARSHALL: If it hadn't been for Scott...
Talking about me again?
GRANT: Well?
He's the muscle, the petty thief from Soweto.
We're not being held up by a common criminal.
GRANT: Right, with me.
Yes, Ma'am.
Now, let me make this clear.
Whoever it is you're most afraid of right now is nothing...
Compared to me.
GRANT: All right. He's got good family?
Yeah. You've got a mother...got a father...
And two sisters.
Right. Find them. Bring them in.
SlNCLAlR: Yes, Ma'am. CAPTOR:
I don't know who the man is we were going to see.
CAPTOR: I didn't see his face.
What was in the case? Hmm?
What was in the case?
Look, what happened out there, happened because of us.
There is no "us." Kate...
Michael, you made your feelings perfectly clear.
When we're out there, you can treat me as a soldier.
GRANT: He sold route maps for an armored truck company.
Get them all on the phone!
I want every truck, every driver, stopped and secured, now!
This isn't where my dad lives.
Don't you worry, lad. You'll see your dad soon enough.
DRlVER: Terry...
Jeff, that's my boy.
Jeff, that's my son.
DRlVER: Terry, what the fuck?

Hey. Hey, where are you taking my son?
DRlVER: Take me. CONNOLLY:
Where are you taking him, sir?
CONNOLLY: I want you to look at the trees.
You see the way they bend in the wind?
I want you to watch the shapes that they make. Okay?
Please...
That's a fine boy you have there.
CONNOLLY: Come on, Hugo! Come on, let's go!
CONNOLLY: Hugo, move! Hugo!
(GUNSHOTS FlRED) (SCREAMlNG) CONNOLLY: Aw, fuck me!
CONNOLLY: For fuck's sake.
Take his hands off. Put a bullet through his teeth.
(REPORTER TALKS ON RADlO) GRANT: How did we miss this?
A call did go out. The robbery was already in progress.
All three guards were shot.
What's strange is that no money was taken.
What about the other guy?
Shot, hands severed, jaw blown to pieces, presumably...
To hide his identity, yeah.
Well, the only survivor was the little boy.
Son of one of the dead guards.
He was abducted near his home earlier in the afternoon.
Jesus...
The CCTV in the back of the van was sprayed...
But we've managed to reconfigure some of the images captured just beforehand.
Daniel Connolly.
SlNCLAlR: Hardcore IRA.
The Good Friday Agreement put him on the run.
SlNCLAlR: Kosovo, Chechnya...
Now, he touts himself around as some kind of mercenary.
All right, there was something else on that van.
I want to know what it was.
This is not about money. This is about hate.
What's the matter?
Tell me.
I had a dream last night.
I was a boy, back at my mother's old house.
You could smell the chips frying in the kitchen.
And the creaky floorboard, on the bottom step.
I came down the stairs and opened the front door.
Someone was standing there...
Someone I knew.
Yeah?
They'd come to kill me.
(WHlSPERS) To kill me...
Teague!
So?
Hugo downloaded the files, before he got shot.
We're going visiting.
But Daniel, the data's no good to us without a hacker.
We don't have Hugo.
Well, there's another Hugo coming.
Hey.
What you got there?
MURPHY: What have I got?
Yeah.
That, Sergeant, is a future-proof, impenetrable encryption data storage unit.
Wow. Mmm-hmm.
You know, in my experience, nothing is impenetrable...
We know it wasn't money, they were after, so what was it?
Data, on the encryption device.
What kind of data?
Well, that we don't know.
Different units belong to various organizations.
But, somehow, I doubt they were interested in the payroll for the Cape Town ballet, or the University's annual accounts.
They might just be interested in the security protocols of a major defense contractor.
ATAT Systems.
GRANT: Who's the main man here, in Cape Town?
SlNCLAlR: Kenneth Bratton.
Did you say, "Bratton"? SlNCLAlR: Yeah.
You have our attention, Sergeant.
Chemical weapons guy. Latif.
Could be something.
CONNOLLY: Mr. Bratton.
Who are you people? How did you get in here?
BOY: (ON VlDEO) Hi, Mom.
CONNOLLY: Lovely family, Ken.
BRATTON: What have you done with them?
They're fine. They'll be fine.
What do you want?
Oh, I think you know exactly what I want.
You know Bratton was captured by the Republican Guard in Iraq?
And, that, John Porter... John Porter got him out.
In February, 2003.
No weapons designer should have been anywhere near there.
And that was about the same time Scott was booted out of Delta Force.
What if there's a connection?
The man that got shot in the face at the heist...
May have been Hugo Lynch.
A computer hacker that worked with Connolly.
Why?
Because a new computer hacker just came to town.
An American know as Julian Buckley.
Wanted for cleaning out the United Bank of
Ireland two years ago.
And he's been flagged?
Mmm-hmm. By Interpol.
In from Kinshasa. Paid for his ticket in cash two hours before the flight.
And you think he's a replacement for Lynch?
I think it's a possibility, Colonel.
I've tracked his hire car to an address in the Bo-Kaap area.
Colonel, I'd like to volunteer to talk to Bratton.
Volunteer? Yes, Ma'am.
No. Stonebridge?
GRANT: All right, I need you guys out in the field.
Finally.
You're gonna be tracking a man called Buckley.
Sergeant Richmond will brief you.
I need you to go and see Bratton. Okay.
All right? Kid gloves.
You have your orders.
You know, I'm the one that should be talking to Bratton.
Now's not the time.
Now's not the time.
Well, let me remind you of something, buddy.
I'm the guy that got kicked out of the army for something that I did not do...
And pricks like Bratton are out there playing, "Hide the fucking chemical weapons."
You don't know that.
I do know that.
There's something else I know.
I got screwed over in Iraq, by someone.
I wanna find them. I wanna kill them.
I thought you were with me on that one?
Yeah, I just think, maybe, you're letting your personal life get in the way of this mission.
Personal life?
That's fucking funny, coming from you.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I'm talking about, Michael.
If you wanna play hide the sausage with Kate...
Oh, that's genius coming from you!
You have no fucking clue what you're talking about.
Prick.
Asshole.
That's him.
I've never been so glad to see a terrorist in my life.
MARSHALL: Thank you for seeing me so quickly.
BRATTON: It's fine.
I know the British High Commission...
Isn't in the business of wasting people's time.
BRATTON: And you're here as a...?
Criminal Intelligence liaison with the South African police.
Right.
Uh, Miss Marshall, this is Darin Morgan.
Pleasure.
You're with ATAT?
He's our military consultant.
Just oiling the wheels, that's all.
If you'd like to come through...
Thank you for your concern.
As a result of the robbery...
I've already requested that our security codes are changed immediately.
Well, if I can advise you, sir, I do think you need to be careful.
Of course.
Have you had any contact with this man?
No. Who is he?
His name is Daniel Connolly.
We believe he may be allied with a terrorist called Latif.
He's the one who attacked the hotel in India.
His stated aim is to attack the West with a weapon of mass destruction.
(SCOFFS) Well, he's looking in the wrong place.
We design weapon systems here but we don't house them.
That would be against South African law.
And we're very scrupulous.
Your family not around?
No, school holidays. They're at our beach house.
Sounds nice.
Hmm. Yeah, it is.
BRATTON: I appreciate the offer, but really my security is more than adequate.
MARSHALL: I understand you were in Iraq, before the invasion.
Yeah, that's right.
Doing what, might I ask?
I was asked to report on Saddam's weapons stock.
Which was non-existent?
Well, he fooled cleverer men than me.
It's my card.
Thank you.
She's military. What did she want?
Uh, something about the, uh, bank job robbery.
And, what's that got to do with Iraq?
I don't know.
Let me speak to a contact in Whitehall.
I'll find out where she's from and get them to back off.
MORGAN: We don't want any trouble, Ken.
What the fuck is going on?
Fuck, I think he made us.
No, he didn't make us.
Shit. He made us. Move, move, move!
Go around, buddy!
Move, move!
Stop! Stop!
SCOTT: Stay down! Stay down, now!
Stay down! Fuck!
(YELLlNG CONTlNUES) (GUNSHOTS FlRED) (PEOPLE SCREAMlNG) SCOTT: Fuck!
Someone call an ambulance!
SCOTT: Fucker!
Get out of the way!
CONSTRUCTlON WORKER: What the fuck are you doing, man?
Michael, get a medic!
(PHONE RlNGlNG) Fuck!
(PHONE BEEPS ON) Yeah?
You were supposed to call 20 minutes ago.
Yeah, I'm here now, huh.
TEAGUE: (ON PHONE) The Kimberly Hotel.
Be there in 10 minutes, no weapons, or the deal's off.
SCOTT: Kimberly Hotel, 10 minutes, got it.
SCOTT: Don't worry about that. Come on, come on, come on.
(RADlOS CHATTERlNG) GRANT: Bring that up.
Colonel Grant, you wanted to speak to me?
When you met with Kenneth Bratton did you, at any point, intimate that he was lying?
Certainly not. Although I'm fairly certain he was.
Well, he's put in a complaint about you, and wants you to back off.
What does the Ministry say?
Well, they're all twitchy aren't they?
ATAT's one of the largest publicly-traded companies in the U.K.
Yes, and Connolly is targeting them.
He should be as concerned about that as we are.
Then, why isn't he?
Excuse me. Stonebridge and Scott need to speak to you urgently.
STONEBRlDGE: (ON PHONE) Colonel, Buckley's down...
And Scott's going to take his identity.
Run that by me, again.
Scott took a call on Buckley's phone.
Yeah, the bloke heard an American accent, must've thought it was Buckley.
Yeah, 'cause we all sound the same, right?
And you're seriously suggesting Scott goes in there as Buckley, unarmed?
That's right. The only thing is, he has 10 minutes to get there.
How do we know Connolly won't recognize Buckley?
He had half a torn playing card, in his pocket.
We just don't think he will.
There's also the fact that Buckley's an expert hacker.
What's she saying?
Well, I can brief him in Cyber Ops.
In ten minutes? On the phone?
Well, the alternative is we surround the building.
Bring his contact in for interrogation.
Yeah, but if we do that, Connolly's in the wind.
Put Scott on.
Scott.
Yeah?
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
Yeah, I'm listening.
Patch this through.
No, Colonel, I've got his file in my hand.
It's a green light, buddy.
CONNOLLY: And she's Irish, is she?
BRATTON: Kate Marshall. Captain Kate Marshall.
She's British Army intelligence.
Darling, you should be ashamed of yourself.
We have a contact at the Ministry of Defense in London.
She's assigned to some special tactical unit. Led by...
Colonel Eleanor Grant.
BRATTON: Look, I'm telling you everything I know.
I'm cooperating with you completely.
I just want to know that my family are going to be safe.
This'll soon be over, Ken.
I have a good feeling about this.
It's all going to end perfectly.
We're late.
Yeah, well...
He doesn't show up, I'll just have myself a drink.
If I hear gunfire, I'll come help.
Don't worry yourself, buddy. You hear gunfire, I'll be dead.
Here, that's mine.
I got Buckley's.
Can I grab a Laphroaig on the rocks, please?
BARTENDER: La-what?
Laphroaig, uh...
Just give him a scotch. Neat.
SCOTT: Thanks, what are you drinking?
Same.
Can you make that two?
SCOTT: Fuck me, that taste like... Shite.
Everything here is.
Well, I don't know about that.
Quite a lovely Irish accent going on, huh?
Thank you.
You, uh, you meeting someone?
Yeah. You.
There's a room upstairs.
Want to see it?
Take your clothes off.
What's the matter?
I'm just wondering whether you're going to fuck me or kill me.
Take them off, and you'll find out.
What about you?
Good things come to those who wait.
Is that a promise?
Well?
Turn around.
Do I get the part?
You sure do.
Who's that? A friend.
I love a threesome.
That's not the kind of threesome I was talking about.
What's wrong? Not pretty enough for you?
Fuck, no! Ahh...
Shit.
I'm looking for a friend of mine. Big guy. American.
Upstairs.
STONEBRlDGE: (ON COMMS) Scott's been taken, I'm in pursuit.
Charlie one is a gray-panel van heading north.
Checking coordinates.
Bringing you onto visual.
We've got you.
GRANT: Zero one, do you have eyes on the van?
Negative, I have no visual of Charlie one.
We're trying to track Scott by his cell phone.
That's not gonna work! Scott gave me his cell phone!
He took Buckley's with him.
STONEBRlDGE: (ON COMMS) I have two exits up ahead.
Muizenberg or the airport?
Julia, do you hear me? Muizenberg or airport?
MURPHY: Satellite locked on Charlie one. Switching.
Two exits there. Which one? Muizenberg or the airport?
MURPHY: Exit 26. Muizenberg.
You've got them. They're right there with you. Right there!
STONEBRlDGE: Shit!
STONEBRlDGE: Charlie one is in the wind. I repeat,
Charlie one is in the wind.
Shit.
MURPHY: Satellite uplink's been lost.
The accepted wisdom is that, whoever's in charge in Egypt...
In Libya, wherever, there's always opportunities.
MORGAN: My enemy's enemy is my friend.
Should be our company motto.
You all right there, Ken?
Of course.
"My enemy's enemy is my friend."
If there was a problem, you'd tell me, right?
You'd be the first.
CONNOLLY: Mr. Buckley, I presume.
I liked her welcome much better.
You were late.
I was followed.
Oh yeah? By who?
How the fuck should I know?
See, the thing is...
I have a unit of British military intelligence looking for me.
Section 20...
Good for you.
It's headed by a woman called Eleanor Grant.
Do you know her?
No. I don't know her.
See, back in the day, she used to send pricks just like you...
To kill me.
Do you want my fucking services or not?
Oh, yes, I do, very much.
But you're not Julian Buckley.
You're a fucking liar.
And fucking liars like you all get the same treatment...
Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck you!
Last coordinates were down in the valley. Laurensford.
It's farm country.
All right, it's open country, proceed with caution.
GRANT: Do you understand?
STONEBRlDGE: (ON COMMS) Roger that.
Shit.
Fuck. Shit.
Eyes on Charlie One.
Fuck me!
Stonebridge, report.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Sergeant, report!
Fuck you!
That was Scott.
I'm going in.
Jesus!
STONEBRlDGE: Fuck.

( dance music playing ) ( crowd chattering )  - ( glass crashes ) - ( tim yelling )
Who the fuck invited you anyway?
- Chill out, dude. - I'm gonna fuck you till you love it.
- Chill out. - Oh, family style, dude.
And then I'm gonna fucking stab you.
There she is. She's coming.
( laughs loudly ) yo, that's hilarious, ben.
- You're funny, man. - Whoa, is that nancy?
Oh hey. Hi.
Oh god, I owe you a call.
You owe us a meeting actually.
Do I?
We redid our lookbook.
To show your guy in l.A. At south willard.
- Oh right, ryan. - Ryan.
Oh shit. You know what?
I'm gonna email him right now.
- Thanks. - Cool.
Those neanderthals are effed the eff up.
- Yeah, that's kinda their thing. - So dirty, but you know what?
- Hmm? - I kinda love it. - Argh!
Kirsten, christin,
- Meet cam and ben. - Hi.
- How are you doing? - Hello, ladies.
Wait, so you guys are both named christin?
- Huh-uh. - No.
- I'm kirsten and this is christin. - Got it.
So what do you say, nancy?
- Shots and then we hit the dior event? - Whoo!
Ladies, you gotta pace yourselves.
One night in new york is like a month st. Louis time.
Well, let's get this month started, right? - Party started. - Ow!
Domingo: Is he cool or--?
You know ben. He doesn't hold grudges,
But he's not gonna fake like everything is all right
When it isn't, you know?
Yeah.
Hey, you don't think he heard
About the details or anything like that, right?
Well, rachel did do this one blog
About black dudes versus jewish dudes. That was you.
Ha ha, motherfucker. Whatever.
For your services, my friend.
Oh, don't be cheap. Okay.
And check this shit out.
What is this? What did you do?
What could be better than a weed spray called rasta monsta?
It's the essence of marijuana in a bottle.
Wait, you're not actually selling these, right? These are for fun?
It started off as research and development,
But every time I sold it to a regular,
They were fucking going crazy for it. It could be big, man.
Are you out of your mind?
If rene sees this, he'll murder me and you.
Well, okay, cool,
But I'm not wasting this shit.
Rene: It's nothing about the inside.
It's all about the outside, baby.
- It's beautiful. - I like the outside.
- Like that? Like the colors? - Yeah, I like the green.
So everything in that video is for real?
Even the jamaican guy?
He was so angry I thought he was, you know, an actor.
It's all real, my friend. The streets of new york-- they don't lie.
You know, I've had kids all week asking me,
"when am I gonna get rasta monsta?"
Rasta monsta's for the children.
Awesome. Great to finally meet.
Looking forward to doing business with you.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
Rasta monsta hits the suburbs.
Even the air smells different out here.
Huh, boss? You smell that?
Come on, mamita. Pick up the phone, baby.
Ah, this is nice. I like this.
What now?
I'm saying we busted out of the bodega.
It's only a matter of time now before we go national.
Yeah, it's a real fucking significant moment right now.
Jabar: Come on, boss. It's time to celebrate.
Let's go to the ballet, fellas.
Mega nortons--
Rated the second best titty bar in new haven.
Why the fuck we ain't going to the best one?
I called ahead.
No sneakers.
Fuck it. Let's go.
And that's why it's called the great american scissors road test--
Because we'll actually put the scissorso work
And see what they can do.
It's like, why are fiskars scissors so ubiquitous?
Similarly, does anyone actually use
Pinking scissors anymore?
And so on.
Good.
Nice, montana. I like it.
Rachel.
Did you have anything?
Yes, I do.
Um, I have not printed it out yet,
But it's actually not too dissimilar
From what montana was pitching out.
But it was more like basters.
You know, the-- the squeegee things
That you find in the kitchen,
Sort of investigate that.
Right. Okay.
See you later. Bye.
Oh my god, you guys, I'm so sorry.
I mean, you schlepped all the way up here.
Ryan left.
He went to l.A. Already. He took the earlier flight.
Someone should he calledou. I'm al sorry.
But, you know, listen, he's here all the time.
We'll definitely go out for coffee, drinks, sushi-- whatever.
Well, what about a conference call
Or a video chat?
Oh, I don't do that.
Seriously, it's just too forced. It's not my style.
Christin and kirsten. You want a return, right?
Oh shit. No, I'll take 'em.
These are the girls from last night--
Buyers from gadzooks. I'm babysitting them.
We're doing business with them. Just give me one second.
Hey, st. Louis in the house.
- Both: Hey, nancy. - Ooh, stereo.
Kirsten: So we heard back from phillip
And he didn't love the neanderthal stuff as much as we did.
Oh no. We did kind of expect that, right?
After all, it is still the midwest, darlings.
Christin: Yeah, but we still want to bring something back super fresh.
We're getting killed by pac-sun.
All right, let me think about it for a few days
- And I'll come up with something. - Kirsten: Awesome.
Oh and hey, what's up with the boom boom room? Because we couldn't get in last night.
Christin: And that was with kirsten offering to blow the doorman.
- Kirsten: Shut up. - Kidding.
I knew we should have stayed at the standard.
All the boys at the mondrian are busted.
Okay, well, let me make a few phone calls
And I'll get back to you, all right?
- Awesome. - All right. Ciao, bellas.
Nancy, what about crisp for them?
Oh no, that's not the right fit,
Not where you should be focusing your energies.
We've got plenty of energy to go around.
Gadzooks? They do huge volume.
I'm not even sure if you guys could deliver.
Oh, come on, we always deliver.
Oh, do you, ben?
Yeah.
Listen, guys,
Let's just focus on making south willard happen.
All right?
I told you we should have never done
Those freebie st. Maximilian's t-shirtsor her.
Now she's gonna see us as amateurs, like we can't do real business.
I don't know, man.
Have you ever seen a gadzooks?
It's like a department store.
It's not really where I see crisp.
Well, start picturing it, homey,
'cause until barneys starts calling,
Piecing together these little tiny orders from store to store
Is not a way to grow a business.
Isn't that what you said to me?
Yeah.
And these girls can order 500 sweatshirts
At once.
That would be nice.
And nobody in new york would even know.
It's like that billboard we saw of clooney, remember?
Selling coffee in tokyo.
I mean, we'd be crazy not to try to get this order.
Our shit is so much better than the neanderthals.
We should do it on principle.
See what I'm saying?
I see what you're saying, man. ( rap music playing )
Eddie: Yo, see those up there? I like those.
Yeah, they don't have those in the city. The city's too crowded.
Titties there need to be more compact.
But here-- whoo! They've got space
And they've got fresh milk. Whoo!
What about you, boss?
Jabar: Yeah, boss, you like the compact city titties
Or these big old country titties?
Damn, man, I get no reception in here.
I'm sorry.
It's not you. It's me.
Listen, not for nothing, but if I was you, honey,
I would clone that ass.
I fucking need to make a phone call.
Debbie's been giving him the silent treatment, man.
His freaking head is about to pop off.
You know, I've never seen rene like this.
He's whupped, son.
( imitates whip crack )
Hey. What up?
- Hey. - Sorry I'm late, man.
Yeah, so am I, 'cause I gotta go now.
What? I just got here.
I know, but you're like 25 minutes late.
Oh shit.
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just-- now I have to go
To this meeting I didn't have to go to before.
Okay. All good.
Do your thing, miss magazine queen.
You look fresh today.
Um, so lulu and I
Are having dinner with pals tonight.
Do you want to-- do you want to maybe get drinks after or--?
Damn. My good friend from cleveland,
Light skin leon's in town.
And I promised him to take him to a club.
So I don't think it's gonna work.
Oh okay. All right, we'll do it another time then.
Yeah, cool. I'm around.
Did you talk to ben about us or whatever?
Yeah.
Yeah, I talked to him.
Okay, and?
He's cool.
Cool.
Yeah.
- All right, I'll see you later. - Yeah.
Bye.
Awkward as fuck, right?
( growls )
Honestly, you were ridiculous.
I can't stop thinking about it.
Oh, cam, you say that to all the girls.
No, I don't.
- You got skills. - Why, thank you.
- They're coming. - Oh, let me call you back, all right?
Yeah, sure. See you. ( kirsten and christin laughing )
- Tell me about the dress. - It's black with one sleeve and--
Kirsten, christin.
You guys were at the party last night with nancy.
- Ben. - Oh.
- Cam. - Are you guys staying here?
- No, we're just here for a meeting. - Oh.
But do you want to join us for a drink?
And sneak a peek before we sell out spring 2012?
Sorry, guys, we're kind of-- office hours are over.
- Yeah. - We're just trying to unwind.
It's our last night in ♪ new york. ♪ ooh ooh! ( laughter )
- It was nice seeing you guys. - Yeah, you too.
Hey have you been to the jane yet?
Uh, no.
We're trying to hit up the boom boom room tonight.
- Ooh. - The boom boom room?
- Nah. - Forget that spot. Nobody even goes there.
- Really? - Cornball city.
- Oh. - Yeah.
No, jane's where it's at tonight.
You know d.J. Doris?
Hottest party in new york. That's where you gotta go.
But just be careful, 'cause the door can be a little tricky.
Do you think you guys could help us out? ( buzzes )
Debbie: Hello.
Let me in, baby.
Get out of here, rene, you phony sack of shit.
Oh, come on, man. I just need five minutes, baby--
- Just five minutes.
- Five minutes?
You've already wasted hours of my life that I can never have back.
Come on, baby.
I'm standing on my hands and knees out here for you.
Let me in, please.
You are full of shit.
All right, so I'm not on my hands and knees,
But you know what? I'm gonna stand right here till you let me in
And I'm gonna keep buzzering your buzzer. ( buzzing )
Look, mami, I know-- I know what I did was wrong.
The truth is, I can't even fuck with you right now, rene.
I've got bigger problems with nilda.
- Some shit's been happening. - What?
She has been staying out all night, falling in with the wrong crowd.
They're filling her head with ideas.
What kind of ideas?
Gay ideas.
She hasn't been coming home and I can't sleep.
Baby, you want me to talk to her?
For what?
So she can learn how to lie and manipulate people?
Dude, so today at lunch
Domingo runs in, like, 30 minutes late.
You shouldn't take that personally.
He runs on weed dealer time.
There it is.
Maybe now that ben knows about it
It's like the mystery is gone.
That's a brutally honest way of looking at it.
Wow.
- Oh my god, I'm starving. - Yeah, me too.
- Mm, pickles. - There's a lot of pickles.
Oh my god.
Lulu d actually made it to bushwick.
Are you kidding me? It's good to see you.
Oh look, she brought her highbrow friend with her too.

So what's-- what's up with all the pickles?
- We make them here. - What?
Yeah, and we just got the lot next door.
We're gonna expand the garden and grow grapes.
Wow, very sustainable of you.
Fuck sustainability.
I am gonna coppola the shit out of this place.
And I'm gonna put all these fucking hipsters to work for me making wine.
- Okay. - Yeah, do you want to see the garden?
Yeah, I want to-- I want to see the garden. - ( distant siren wailing ) - ( sighs )

Wow, total disrespect for the dom.
I gotta respect that.
Yo, thanks for hooking it up, kappo.
Man, this-- this could all be gone tomorrow.
That's why we need to enjoy it tonight.
Good looking out, kappo.
Thank you.
You do know how to show us heartland girls
A good time, mr. Kaplan.
It is my pleasure, kirsten.
Mm, I'm christin.
Yeah.
You said kirsten.
Fucking love you, girl.
Kirsten, christin, we wanted to tell you
About our line crisp. We make tees and hoodies.
Not to be those dudes, but we heard that you guys liked the neanderthals,
And if you take a look, our line is undeniably more fresh.
Boo. Business.
- If you see something you like, we'll ship it to st. Louis. - Yeah.
Oh, I see something I like.
I just don't know if you can ship it.

Nilda, can I talk to you for a minute?

That's okay. I'll do all the talking.
You know this dude?
You heard the girl. She ain't go nothing to say to you.

You keep talking that shit and I'm gonna smack a dress on you.
It's all right, tiffany. We're good.

Yeah.

But it's more like I go through the motions
And I can't wait for it to be over.
And then when I'm with a girl,
It's more like I'm actually there.
Okay, I got you.
You gonna get mad like my moms?
I mean, how could I?
Who you are and who you want to see yourself with,
Baby, that's your business.
That's how you really feel?
Nilda, listen to me.
I understand what it's like
For people to see you differently than you see yourself.
See, most of my life I've been a badass.
Now I'm just trying to be an honest person.
Like those fake-ass earrings you tried to give my mother? ( exhales )
I have my moments. ( laughs )
Yeah.
Wait, you guys aren't leaving, are you?
We're about to go on a bike ride.
- School night. I'm calling a car service. - Yep.
- Really? Well, do you want to come with us? - What?
Yeah. No, come on, it's gonna be a lot of fun.

Come on, man. What up, g?
This is christin, kirsten, cam, mac mode kappo.
Oh, leon, I like that sweatshirt.
Oh, it's do's. I'm just borrowing it.
So cute.
Why don't you tell 'em it's crisp, man?
It says "crisp."
You guys are aware that I've been wearing
The same exact hoodie all night?
Oh, sorry.
Just it looks different on him.
This is really soft.
Yeah, that's the japanese cotton.
Let's throw these guys a bone and write an order.
Nancy's your rep, right?
Yeah, nancy. I'm gonna call that slut right now.
Domingo: Cheers to that shit. ( lock rattlg )
I made mofongo.
I'm not hungry.
I'll have a little. I'm gonna go wash up.
Thanks for bringing her home.
You can go.
Please, debbie, give me another chance.
I'm sorry about the earrings.
You think I care about some goddamn earrings?
That's what makes me songry.
I'm not even like that. You should know that by now.
I'm trying to get to know you, baby.
I just made a mistake.
You should've seen me back in '97.
I was 17 years old and doing music videos.
I was on top of it.
And I had everybody buying me shit--
Expensive shit.
I've been with too many gangsters in my life-- Filthy rich one day, broke and locked up the next.
All I want is someone
I can count on,
Someone who isn't a cheat,
Somebody honest, somebody stable.
That's what I want too.
Is he staying to eat with us?
Eww.
To our favorite new designers.
- Whoo!
- Yay crisp!
- Yay crisp. - Yes.
I don't know why I didn't think about these guys for you sooner.
Woman: Sorry, this one didn't work either.
Oh shit. Really?
Oh, you know, those fucking
Fraud protection alert things.
- You know, I got it. - Oh, no no no no, nancy.
- Nancy, absolutely not. - Kirstin: Nancy, stop.
- No no, we'll-- - I insist. My pleasure. Thank you.
Chrissie, afterparty in our room?
- Love it. - Kaplan: Love it.
I love you, kirsten.
I love you, christin.
- I love you more. - No, I love you more.
- I love you. - I love you more.
You're a fucking hooker, but I love you! Your mom's a hooker!
Sorry.
There are not guys as cute as you in st. Louis.
- No, I'm one of a kind. - Yeah, well,
There's not girls as cute as me in new york.
There are now. ( cheering )
- Are you good? - Yeah.
Here.
Have a little whiskey before we go.
Okay.
There's nothing like drinking and driving, right?
I guess. ( laughs ) All right, motherfuckers.
- Let's fucking go! - ( cheering ) ( car horns honking )
- Whoo! - ( whistling ) Whoo!
Whoo!
Sweetheart, babydoll,
I think I'm gonna call it a night.
I'm so tired. Forgive me, hmm?
Oh okay, sweetie. We'll talk lat-- ow! Lady.
Let's go, ben.
You know what? I'm gonna take a rain check.
I gotta get up early in the morning.
Ben, come on. Let's go. Let's play.
Next time. Next time, I promise.
All right? Next time.
- Lame. - Have fun tonight.
These losers are bailing.
Let's go. Let's go.
The first is bank and west 4th
And the second will be...
Somewhere in brooklyn.
Greenpoint, please. Thank you.
So I hope you're happy.
You guys just really went for it, huh?
Made sure those girls wrote you out an order.
You just threw everything that I said right out the window.
I'm sorry.
I guess I can be kinda stubborn
When I get my mind set on something.
It's not as cute as you think.
Ben, no no no no.
- No, that's not-- - I'm sorry. That's--

[man howling]
[howling continues]
[chuckles]
woman: Can you-- man:  Hello. woman:

I like to move it move it. woman:
You know. man: All right.
This is best day of my life. woman:
No. I'm asking-- man:  Oh, what day? woman:
Yes. man: Uh, it's, uh...
Wait a minute.
[laughs]
A stupid question. "What day is it?"
Ah. Sorry. woman:  Okay. man:
It's 24 July.
[laughs]
woman:
It's the best day ever.
woman: You might be wondering why I'm up at this ungodly hour.
Like others, I believe that the time between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M. is one where the veil between this world and the next is the thinnest.
Often during this time of the day,
I hear the sound of my name uttered by an unseen presence.
[dog barks]
[rooster crows]
woman: Good morning.
[woman #2 speaking native language]
[woman laughs]
man: Whoa.
[laughs]
[speaking native language] That's nice.
man: And here we go into the garage.
That's right.
We're going to ride in the elevator.
All right. Let's ride it.
Here it is.
That's right.
This is the elevator at the Market Parking Garage in Roanoke, Virginia.
This elevator has been made famous right here.
Here we go.
Here we are at six, which is burned out.
Just your basic Dover elevator.
For all of those of you at Dover Elevators, a good brand of elevator.
Now we're gonna go back down to one.
All right. Now it's time to go off to work.
[engine turning]
Wasn't that fun?
Gray: You know how much strength it takes to rebel?
Ha. So this is a night in the life of S. Gray, man.
You know what I'm saying?
Sleeping on the coach... with nobo--
Grinding my ass off every day.
Shorties not enjoying their mother.
Man not enjoying his wife or his woman--his lady.
[baby wailing]
Just bullshit, man.
Alpha male trapped in and locked in through religion and politics.
Soon enough, man, my plans will all come into perfection.
[celestial choir]
[man snores]
[phone rings]
[toy rattles]
[alarm beeping]
[rooster crows]
[phone rings]
[celestial choir]
woman:
[softly] I love you. man:
[softly] I love you too.
[man coughs, gags]
[triumphant orchestral finale]
[boat horn blows]
man speaking native language: You need to have a pee.
Tai-Chan.
If you don't pee, you can't watch TV, can you?
Hmm?
Hey. Here we go.
boy: Why do you have lots of hair growing? man speaking native language:
Because I'm a man. boy speaking native language:
Women don't have hair, not as much.
[man speaking native language]
Say good morning to mummy. boy speaking native language:
Good morning. man speaking native language:
Here's the incense. boy speaking native language: I don't want to. man:
Daddy will do it alone then, Tai-Chan.
Tai-Chan, here, sound the bell.
When daddy has put the incense in, you can sound the bell.
[bell rings]
Not yet.
When daddy has put the incense in here.
[bell rings]
That's it. Good morning, mummy. boy speaking native language:
Good morning, mummy. man speaking native language:
Good, now put the incense out.
Good. boy speaking native language: All done.
I want some water.
[man speaking native language]
[woman laughs]
[man coughs]
man: Today we're gonna videotape Sasha doing his first ever shave.
Sasha: Oh, boy. man:
Sasha is how old now?
Sasha: Uh...15. man:  All right.
Sasha: 15. man:
The first thing Sasha's doing is getting the water hot to put a hot cloth on his face.
Sasha: Yes. man:
So that it'll warm up your face and moisturize your skin.
Does he have, like, a nice, warm face now?
Sasha: It's always been hot. man:  All right.
Whatever you say there, dude.
Actually, we should probably do a close-up of your-- those whiskers.
They're really long now.
[chuckles] Sasha:  Thank you. man:
You need to, like, really lather it up.
Sasha: Okay. man:
I don't think you need to put it on your nose.
Sasha: Yeah.  Yeah. man:
[laughs]
Sasha: Five-blade razor, which we got as a sample.
Schwing! Is it time? man:
Go ahead.
Sasha: Okay, you're shaving for me.
This is embarrassing.
I'm bleeding. man: Yes.  Don't worry.
You will survive it. Sasha:  Wow. man:
Don't worry. It will be all right.
Sasha: Oh, wow.
This is torture.
Ow! man:
Yes. man: It'll sting for a little while.
There, just dry yourself off.
And let's take a look at the nice...
Sasha: Meh. man:  Nice clean shave.
Good job, buddy. Here.  Sasha:
Here's what we do. Sasha:  Agh. man:
Don't--give me-- face the camera here.
And we put a little piece on there.
See? And it sticks to the bloody part.
And voila, he's done.
Hey, wait. High five, buddy.
You survived it.
[animal bells ring]
man: Guys, it's not good to fall in love with girls
You have wives, so you are all right.
Whereas I don't have a wife.
Bitch. man:
What day is it today? man #2:
The 24th. man speaking native language:
No way. man #2: Then what day do you think it is? man:  The 25th. man #2:
It's not the 25th. man:
It's the 25th. man #2:
24th. man speaking native language:
[man speaking native language]
[man cheering]
man: We're documenting everything.
Bobby: Wha-ah-ah! man:  Shh.
Bobby: Dah dah dah dah nah nah nah nah!
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah! man:
Bobby, let Mommy sleep.
[Bobby laughs]
man: Are you feeling okay?
Cathy: Yeah, I'm just really tired, you know. man:  Okay.
Bobby: You feel weird?
Okay, this is how you'll be weirder.
Whoa, tch. man:
Bobby: Okay, Mom.
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah! man:
Bobby, get down. We're gonna let Mommy sleep.
Bobby: Son of a cuss.
Cathy: Thank you.  Thank you.
Um, I do have a question, though,
'cause I--my biggest worry is, you know, of course, my bandages and stuff.
But I've been taking a sh--
I know I can take a shower, but I haven't.
But I thought maybe I could at least try to take a shower before you got here.
Is that okay if I just go ahead and do that?
Oh, good. Okay.
Bobby: Dad, can I come down?
Cathy: Bobby, can we have a talk, though?
Please, please, please? Bobby:  Oh.
Cathy: I just need to have a talk, okay?
Because Grandma is telling me-- all the grandmas, all the friends are saying what a great boy you are.
And of course I know that.
And I know that it's hard.
I've never been in a hospital.
I've never been like this before.
I just need us all to help each other, okay?
And I know that sometimes when we ask you to do something to help, sometimes it's 'cause you don't want to go upstairs 'cause you get scared.
And that's fine. I understand that.
Bobby: Dad's fault.
Cathy:
If it's because you're scared to go upstairs by yourself or downstairs by yourself, just tell me that.
Bobby: I will.  Sometimes... [speaking indistinctly]
And stop videotaping!
Cathy: Bobby... man:
I was gonna give you a camera too.
Cathy:
We're gonna do a project-- a family project, okay?
Can we all agree to do the family project?
If not, then we can't do it. man: Do you want a camera?
Cathy: Okay?  Bobby:
Do you want a camera to videotape me?
Bobby: Mm-hmm.
Cathy: It's gonna be a family project.
I need to have a happy boy today, okay? man:
You have to be happy if you have the video camera.
Bobby: Why? man:
Because it's a happy film.
Cathy: All right? man:
And it has a happy ending.
[sizzling]

The water is an offering for Him.
woman: Okay, we're coming in...
Okay, first of all-- and I'm sure he hears me by now--
let me explain something to you.
Everyone, can you hear me loud and clear?
My son was supposed to be cleaning his room yesterday.
Come on, boy! boy:
Woman! woman:
[chuckles] Woman!
Oh, this is gonna be a long day, as most are. boy:
[groans] woman:
He's always a bundle of joy when he wakes up.
Come on, come get in the shower, get the day going.
We got things to do, places to go. boy:
Yeah. woman:
People to see, futures to make.
[lighthearted music]
man: I had a major heart operation.
I'm very thankful to the beautiful staff.
No job is too big or--or too small.
And even down to a few minutes ago, just wiping my bum, because I had my first-- first poop... [chuckling]
in about a week or so.
So one of them came to the rescue and said,
"Listen, would you like me to trim that up for you, sir?"
So I said, "Yes."
And a very--very, um, courageous young lady in my case,
I think, did the job.
And just, uh, all in a day's work.
[chiming faintly]
I'm very, very grateful for these people that have treated me like...
Just treated me so well.
In a short--short while...
I-I will be on the road to recovery, and I'll be out there again doing crazy things and enjoying life.
[overlapping chatter]
man:
56, 56...57.
61 Rupees.
61 going once, 61 going twice.

[overlapping chatter]
[ultrasound pulses]
Amanda: I'm Amanda.
What makes me joyful this Saturday is this...
And a little terrified and really excited. woman:
Oh, my God, did you feel that?
Let's try again.
[speaking native language]
Have a listen if he's sleeping.
[water dripping]
woman: What's up, Beatrice?
[bird chirping]
man:
Oh, oh, oh, oh... [speaking native language]
[relaxed instrumental music]
woman: All right, then.  Oh!
What a little miracle you are!
Goodness.
Now your mama has made herself a little copy of Mama.
[woman speaking native language]
man singing:
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
I just want to know that I feel strong, you know.
I want to reach the greatest mountain.
Climb, if I want, without all the shouting.
I just want to know that I feel strong, you know.
And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store, raw love.
Life, a day at a time, my love.
Life, a day at a time, don't know.
Love.
Life in a day and life in a day and life in a day...
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.

I want to reach the greatest mountain, climb, if I want, without all the shouting.

And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store, raw love.
Okhwan Yoon: Good morning, everyone.
Bonjour. Buenos días.
Namaste. Salaam alaikum.

I'm traveling around the world by bicycle.
[dog barking]
[man shouting in native language]
Yoon: Today it's been 9 years and 36 days.
[bus horn honking]
This is Kathmandu, Nepal.
I have been in 190 countries so far.
I've been struck by cars six times.
Five times, surgery.
There are so many careless drivers in the world.
I have seen many different sizes of fly.
In North Africa, smaller fly than here.
And Turkey, smaller fly than here.
But this size is same fly in Korea and in Japan and China.
So I feel very emotional.

My name is Randy Raisides, and this is Kenneth V. Fletcher's house.
Giant I-beam... basket with grapes... pipe bender... a billion boxes.
He's kind of a hoarder.
I moved here four years ago, a terrible drug addict.
And in four years, Ken has done two things.
He has sobered me up, and he has lost everything.
Good morning. Ken:  Good morning.
Randy: Kenneth V. Fletcher.
Ken: Loser.
Enabler.
What else?
Destitute human being.
Randy:
Tomorrow Ken leaves for the Canary Islands, where he has gotten a job as a massage therapist.
And I go back to Nebraska, where I'm going to be living with my folks.
He's one of those guys that has a billion ideas and never completes any of them.
Ken wanted a piano as a kid.
Ken couldn't get a piano as a kid.
So three years ago, we looked on Craigslist all summer and went over to the Twin Cities and got pianos!
[Ken playing mid-tempo melody]
The man's a genius. He just never quite had the time.
It looks like the auctioneer's here.
[creaking]
[crash]
man: What's in my pocket?
Well, it's a key.
And it's got a really neat little logo there.

This is a Lamborghini.
And this is my life in a day. woman:

There's a Marc Jacobs key chain that I love.

Are you well?
It's Saturday again.
[men speaking native language] man:
The cold weather is here and August will be worse, so you have to keep warm, Abel. boy speaking native language:
Hey you, this is my patch.
[men speaking native language] boy speaking native language:
Sometimes I make five soles.
When I was little, I once earned 20 soles in a day.
[men speaking native language]

My story is, I can't work, because who else would look after my kids?
My wife passed away, my children's mother.
I've got a 20 year old son who is sick.
He's a retard.
We have to tie him up all day to stop him wandering off.
Fourteen people live in this place.
We have no electricity, no water, no drains.
But we are still alive.
God will not forget us.
He created us.
That is what I believe.
God wouldn't have created this population just to forget us.
[muffled chatter]
[man speaking native language]
[muffled chatter]
Ayomatty: My name is Ayomatty.
I've been in Dubai for 13 years.
I work as a gardener, and I am very happy.
man speaking native language: There is no work at home.
It's more profitable to come to Dubai.
I'm here to earn money to send back to my kids.
man speaking native language: Pray, be seated. woman:
All you think about is your belly.
[man speaking native language] man:
Did you see the fence fell down in those thistles?
Goddamned thistles everywhere.
And you think I'm a prick.

And then watch this.
[laughter]
[women singing in native language]

Jack:
Today is Saturday, the 24th of July.
For the last three years, I've been away from home to do my degree.
And as soon as that finished,
I ended up getting a job at a very demanding company.
So I don't really get to see my old man that much.
But whenever I do see him, we always go to the same place and do the same thing and have a catch-up.
man: I just phoned you.
Jack: Yeah, I just got it, actually.
I was about to phone you back. man:
How you doing? All right?
Jack: Yeah, not bad. man:  Mouthful?
Jack: I'll have a mouthful. man:
You sort the tire out? Jack:  Um... man:
That tire's fucked.
Jack: I haven't had time. man:  That tire's fucked.
You'll get done for that. Seen it?
You got a rip in it.
Jack: Is that a rip? man:
Why don't you film down there, Jack?
Let's see if we see a cup.
Come on, that's it. Jesus.
You're not a student now, you know.
You're a working man.
There's no excuse.
Just here. man:
Is this where we're going?
Jack: Yeah.
man: Two small beef burgers, believe it or not.
Imagine what the large ones are like or the medium ones.
Ridiculous, isn't it? Unbelievable.
Anyway, here you go, Jack.
This way. I'm gonna sit in the car.
[seagulls crying]
What do you got?
Jack: This. man:  Oh.
Is this bit a photograph of you at uni?
Jack: Yeah. man:  Fantastic.
That's fantastic.
I'm gonna get a lovely frame on that,
'cause Nina's got a frame like that.
[laughs]
That's really cool, Jack. Thank you.
Now, you should be very proud of yourself, Jack, considering you almost got chucked out of school.
You was lucky there, weren't you?
Yeah, you've matured, actually-- actually, in the last year or so quite good into a real proper lad, a real gentleman and a nice boy.
[engine turning]
Thanks for that, Jack.
man speaking native language:
Who do you love a lot? boy speaking native language:
My dad... because he brings me fruit.
He cooks my lunch, makes me breakfast.
He prepares everything, all the food we eat.
He cares more about me than his work.
The thing I love the most is my laptop.
In Wikipedia, there are stories, history, math, science, religion.
It has everything.
It is a giant library.
[birds chirping]
man: I love being me.
I love life.
It's all such fun. man speaking native language:

I love my Lord, my heavenly Father, my Creator, from whom all blessings flow. man:
I love doing about 150 miles an hour down a motorway in a good car. man #2:

I think football is the only sport that bring people together. woman speaking native language:
I love... cleaning something that's really dirty so you can see the result. man:

It's such a cool thing.
It remains at one corner.
It keeps its mouth shut.
I love my refrigerator.
Nothing else but my refrigerator. man:
What do you love? man #2:
Women. man:
What do you love? man #3:
Freedom. man:
What do you love? man #4:
Power. man:
[laughs]
woman: I love the word "mamihlapinatapai."
It's from the Yaghan language, which is now a dead language.
But it was spoken in Tierra del Fuego, the very southernmost point of South America.
I've never heard the word said properly, so I could be pronouncing it wrong.
But the meaning is quite beautiful.
It means that moment or feeling when two people both want to initiate something, but neither wants to be the one to start it.
It can be perhaps two tribal leaders both wanting to make peace, but neither wanting to be the one to begin it.
Or it could be two people at a party wanting to approach each other and neither quite brave enough to make the first move.
[birds calling]
Can hear the kookaburras now.
[line ringing]
man:
Currently, I'm calling my mom to ask her what I should say to Emily today.
[line ringing]
woman: Hello? man:
Do you have a second to talk to me? woman:
Sure. man:
Tonight I am hanging out with Emily. woman: Okay. man:
But I was planning on telling her exactly how I feel about her.
And then I don't know.
So I was calling my mother to see-- what should I say to this woman?
[woman laughing]
Okay.
I don't know.
I just think that, you know-- just concentrate on the fact that, you know, you have very, very high feelings of esteem for her, that she's somebody that you've always admired. man:
"Esteem"? Is that the word I should use?
Esteem?
You think she'd like that? woman:
Yeah. Whatever. man:
I just don't know if that's-- woman: You hold her in very high regard. man:
Ok--I don't know if those-- woman: She's a special person in your life. man:
Okay.
I'll try all that.
Hey. I am on the train now.
This is my friend Emily.
[romantic music]
Uh, hello, "Life In A Day."
I'm still with Emily, and we're still hanging out in Chicago.
Um, this is...
We--we just came out of this place, which was cool.
But, uh, I'm gonna leave this thing on in case anything gets climactic.
man: Theresa, look at me.
Theresa:
[scoffs]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Aah!
[romantic music continues] man:
Uh, I asked her if she wanted to go on a romantic date with me sometime, and she says, "No."
Just--just no.
That's really all she said.
Just "no."
She didn't want any of that.
Ever, possibly. Never, ever.
And so, uh...
Well, actually, I said,
"What about the possibility of a possibility?"
And she said-- She said no to that.
No possibility. None.
woman: Okay, let me say that it is meant for women to kneel down.
For example, a woman is supposed to kneel down for a man. man:
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to show us how you do it? woman:
Yes. man:
So you greet Moses, like, traditionally.
[Moses speaking native language]
man: Wow.  Wow.
Moses, how do you feel about it?
She comes, and she kneels down every day?
Moses: Yes, because I'm a man.
She has to respect. woman:
It's the culture.
[upbeat music]
[cheers and applause]
man singing:
Wise men say only fools rush in.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
David: Hi, Grandma.  It's David.
I'm good. I'm still-- Yeah, I'm in New York.
It's--Yeah, it's been really hot here, but I'm having fun.
Uh, anyway, I wanted to call you, because, uh, you know my friend, uh, Nick, that I-- that you've met a lot...
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
He's a very nice boy.
Uh...
Well, I wanted to tell you that he's, um, not-- not just my friend.
He's--he's my boyfriend.
Um, and it's something that I've wanted to tell you for a while, but I wasn't really sure how you would react, so I was a little nervous to tell you.
Um...
I-I love you too.
Yeah.
I love you too.
And I'm hoping that-- that maybe you can love Nick too, um, because he's really important to me, so I'm hoping he can be really-- really important to you too.
Yeah.
Well, that-- that means a lot to me.
Yeah. Thank you.
I--Yeah, I love--
I love you too.
I do. Yeah.
Yeah, my parents know. Yes.
Well, Grandma, they call it being gay now.
You don't have to say "homosexual."
It's not--Yeah.
Yes, it's not a disease. Thank you.
man: Here, throw some cheese to those ducks.
Get closer to them. I'm taking a video, Sarah.
Sarah: They might bite me. man:
No, they won't bite. Ducks don't bite.
Come on. I'm making a video.
Walk on out into them. It'll be a good video. man #2:
Would you like me to take both of you? man: Oh. man #2:  Take another picture of you? man:
Thank you. man #2:
Just tell me what do you want me to do. man: Just...just... man:
So marriage truth number one-- uh, love is a battlefield.
[laughter]
Um, listen, you two are going to fight like hooded roosters.
Let's just get it out there. It's science.
You know, place any two animals in a contained area together, um, you know, there will be awesome tenderness, but also there will be blood.
[laughter]
Tristam: That is my pocket Walt Whitman.
He was surely one of the greatest poets that ever lived, and if my babies can read Walt Whitman day and night and learn from him, I'll be very happy.
After all, babies, he did say,
"I am August.
I do not trouble my soul to vindicate itself."
No, he didn't say "soul." He said, "I do not trouble..." woman:
That's enough, Tristam, you'll use up all the memory.
This is self-indulgent, and-- Please stop.
They need winding. Please stop, Tristam.
Tristam: "I do not trouble my spirit..." woman:
Stop being so selfish and putting yourself first.
Please, I've been looking after them all day.
Just stop it.
Tristam: "I do not trouble my soul to--
"I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood." woman:
Okay, fine. man:
Ann and John are today renewing their vows in the light of their 50 years experience of marriage.
Rather unusually, each of this special couple has agreed to write the vows of the other.
That is, Ann has written John's vows, and John has written Ann's. man speaking native language:
Pull, pull. woman speaking native language: This one doesn't lift me up.
[man laughing]
woman speaking native language: There is a new one over here.
[man speaking native language] man speaking native language:
Can you manage it? woman speaking native language:
You have to pull using your dorsal muscles. woman speaking native language:
It won't budge.
[man speaking native language] woman speaking native language:
John, it is necessary to address one or two shortcomings in, uh, the physical side of marriage.
Surely no one would argue that there are certain physical demands a wife can request of a husband, and Ann asks you that you address these issues right now.
[laughter]
Do you agree to wash the windows inside and out?
[laughter]
man speaking native language: It's like at the gym.
You grab here, you grip there, and you position yourself with parallel feet so you can use your dorsal muscles.
Then you pull.
[woman laughs]
woman speaking native language: Oh, really? man:
Ann, John asks if you will agree to let him do that thing you once told him you would let him do on his 40th birthday, but still not have yet done.
[laughter]
So, Ann, in anticipation of your previous answer,
John says, "I suppose an occasional blow job is..."
[laughter]
woman: Are you trying every possible way?
I told you it won't move.
It won't move.
So, what was it you were saying?
[laughter]
man:
Finally, in spite of men obviously being from Mars and women from Venus, do you both promise to love and treasure each other and enjoy your lovely family life together here at Appletree Cottage for as long as you both shall live? both:
We do.
[applause]
[clock ticking]
[dog snoring]
[clock cuckooing]
[timer dings]
man speaking native language: Hey, get up.
What are you doing?
[man speaking native language]
man speaking native language: So let's go.
Are we going?
Let's go.

Good-bye, grandpa.

Climb up, skinny!

Climb up, Virginia. Go, go, slowly.

man: Do the jerk.  Please do the jerk.
By the end, I'm gonna try to get the commander to do the jerk. man #2:
Aah! man:
Why you always got to stick your tongue out?
Punch Eason in the face right now. man #3:
Oh, my God! man:
That's the Rebel Alliance.
And there's the Empire.
Masood: Hi.  This is my room.
And this is our garden.
So my name is Masood...
I live in Afghanistan, Kabul, and I'm a news photographer.
Here is my house.
And he's my father, drinking tea.
My mother is praying.
Farid, my brother, is just-- again is staring in the refrigerator, as always.
Right now I'm in my car, going to Kabul's old city, to take some pictures.
Sometimes I like to just walk around there
looking for a good shot.
These are like my two babies.
I carry them everywhere.
[woman speaking native language]
[Masood speaking native language]
woman:
Here I am by myself, because my husband is a half a world away, going to work, fighting for us.
What shirt should I wear?
Which one do you think will Phil like better?
Hmm? Which one do you think?
That one? Is that one the best?
Masood: Here is the market in the old city.
Most foreigners think that it is dangerous to walk around the streets of Kabul, but as you can see, there is no danger... for us, anyway.
woman: Waiting game.
Waiting game.
[birds chirping]
Masood: So this is a street that's normally selling birds like this.
They call them lovebirds because they are always kissing each other.
Sharon: Oh.
Where are you?
Ooh.
Phil: Hi, Sharon.
Sharon: Hi!
Phil: Hi.  Sharon:
Can you see me?
Phil: Yeah.  You did get all dressed up, didn't you?
Sharon: Yes.  Of course.
It's our date night. [children chattering]
Masood:
Afghanistan comes-- the name of my country comes with the conflict, war, suicide attack, and all the negative points that we--I mean hear and listen in the news.
But there is another side of Afghanistan that you don't normally see.
These girls make me feel optimistic about the future of my country.
Phil: I love you.
Sharon: I love you too.  Stay safe.
Phil: I will, honey.  You too, okay?
Sharon: Okay.
Phil: Bye.  Sharon:
[sniffling]
man speaking native language:
It's not easy to explain motivation.
Can I do something to reunite Korea?
It looks impossible. It looks out of my hands.
But impossible is possible.
Bobby: Dad, do you see my war?
Oh, and the red is bad, the white is good of the helmets.
[imitates gunfire]
Oh!
[humming]
man: Oh, it's not so bad.  Cathy:
No? Is there something that's bleeding under my arm?
Let's see if we can just get this. man:
Ew. Cathy:  Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, what is it?
[man chuckling]
Cathy: What is it? man:
Looks like some kind of--
Cathy: Did that come out of your hair? man:  No, it was on my bag.
It's a ladybug.
Cathy: Oh.
girl:
Any kind of monster or ghosts or a witch. boy: Zombies. man:
What do zombies do?
Okay. You do a great zombie. girl speaking native language:
Snakes and ghosts.
[man speaking native language] man speaking native language:
When I come to work at 1:00 A.M. and I hear little noises here and there.
That scares me a little. woman:
I have a fear of dogs. woman speaking native language:
Cats. man speaking native language:
Rats. boy speaking native language:
Lions. woman: Wasps. woman:
Spiders. girl:
I fear... robbers... rapers... girl:
I'm afraid of losing this place.
woman speaking native language: Cultures I don't understand. man speaking native language:
I am scared of Allah, nothing else. woman speaking native language: I fear nothing.
[woman #2 speaking native language] woman speaking native language:
I'm afraid for all the people that don't know God.
People who don't get saved are going to hell. man:
I afraid of homosexuality.
Homosexuality is like... is like disease, and I'm afraid of disease. man:
I stay in my room, and all I can think about is whether in a couple of years someone else is gonna live here, someone who is not Israeli, maybe... maybe someone Palestinian. man:
I guess politics scares me more than anything.
I wonder if we're gonna get in another war. man speaking native language:
When I leave home in the morning, I'm not sure if I'll return home safely.
No Afghans expect to return home safely. woman speaking native language:
Time is passing, and I don't have a boy or girl and no one will ever call me "mummy." man:
One of the things I fear more than anything right now is that my hair's starting to fall out. woman:
This is what I'm afraid of. woman:
That my husband will leave me for another wife because of a lack of you know what. child speaking native language: Divorce.
Divorce. How awful! woman:
I fear loneliness. man:
Not waking up one morning... and nobody finding you for a week.
That'd be interesting. woman:
Losing someone you love.
That's why I find it very hard to really, really connect with someone.
Because, what do you do when they're gone? girl:
Because what if God isn't real?
I believe in Him, but what if God isn't real?
And we're just going to lie in the ground, dead forever? woman:
And that's what I'm afraid of, being in this grave.
Life is so freakin' short, you know?
man: Dying, I guess.
[animal bells ringing]
[thunder rumbling]
[dog growling]
[man speaking native language] man:
The dogs are frightened of thunder. man speaking native language:
Yeah, they're scared. man:
Vasya, we need to find some fireworks somewhere.
Because in autumn, wolves will come. man:
We need to hurry home. It's going to rain!

[electronic music playing]
woman speaking native language: Look ahead!
[cheers]
[overlapping shouting]
man speaking native language: Unreal.  Unreal.
Look at the side. What are they doing there?
Look at the fighting there.
We can't get out. man speaking native language:
[overlapping shouting]
[sirens blaring]
man speaking native language: Dickhead. man:
I don't want to move out of the way. man speaking native language:
Stop this shit!
[overlapping shouting]
man: A tunnel has become a death trap.
At least 18 people were kicked or crushed to death in a stampede during The Love Parade in Duisburg. woman:
Many of the hundreds of thousands of revelers were unaware of the tragedy unfolding.
[uneasy musical buildup]
man singing:
I want to drink from the greatest water.
I want to have all the things I ought to.
I just want to know that
I feel strong, you know.
I want to reach the golden fountain, beat everyone without all the doubting.
I just want to know that
I feel strong, you know.
And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should be there at the beach.
And who needs books when we've got speech?
And who knows what's in store for raw love?
Life, a penny at a time.
Oh, love, life a penny at a time.
Love, life a penny at a time.
Oh, love.
[fireworks whistling, popping]
man speaking native language: When I close my eyes,
I can see all different people in the world from town to town, from country to country.
I can feel it, I can touch it, I can see it.
I feel like born again because of my haircut.
It's time to continue my journey.
man: Who do you love?
Cathy: My silly boys, the Bobby-ells.
Okay. What do you fear? man:
Well, I guess...
I'm fearless now.
I guess my fear was that you'd get cancer, and you did.
That you'd get it again, I mean.
And you did. But it's over with.
So I'm fearless.
[haunting music]
[overlapping chatter]
[thunder rumbling]
woman:
July 24, 2010.
It's nearly midnight now, and I'm running out of time to make this.
I worked all day long, on a Saturday--yeah, I know.
The sad part is...
I spent all day long hoping for something amazing to happen, something great, something to appreciate this day and to be a part of it and to... show the world that there's something great that can happen every day of your life, in everyone's life.
But the truth is, it doesn't always happen.
And for me, today... all day long, nothing really happened.
I want people to know that I'm here.
I don't want to cease to exist.
[thunder rumbling]
I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that I'm this great person, because...
I don't think I am... at all.
I think I'm a normal girl, normal life.
Not interesting enough... to know anything about.
But I want to be.
And today... even though... even though nothing great really happened, tonight I feel as if something great happened.
[thunder rumbling]
[water dripping rhythmically]

I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.

When I know what's in store, raw love.
Life, a day at a time, my love.
Life a day at a time, don't know.
Love.
Life in a day and life in a day and life in a day and life in a day...
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
I just want to know that I feel strong, you know.

You've reached Dr Stuart Price. The office will be closed until the 24th. If this is an emergency, please try...
STU [ON VOlCE MAlL]: Hi. This is Dr. Stu Price.
I'm getting married, so I'll be out of the country for two weeks.
I'm not sure if I'll have cell service.
If this is a dental emergency, plea...
Nothing. [SPEAKlNG IN THAl]
Daddy, please. You're not helping.
[IN ENGLlSH] I looked into his eyes. Not the eyes of a man.
The eyes of a coward.
[BOTH CONTlNUE SPEAKlNG IN THAl] [CELL PHONE VlBRATlNG]
Excuse me. Phil.
PHlL [ON PHONE]: Tracy.
I'm sorry.
Where the hell are you? It happened again.
Don't say that. Please.
No, this time we really fucked up.
Seriously, what is wrong with you three?
So much, Trace, I don't even know where to begin.
TRACY:
Oh, God.
How bad?
Like no wedding bad?
Yeah.
Little worse than that.
Mm-hm.
You really need to floss more.
Fuck that.
That's why I come here.
Then you should come more than once every two years.
- So you could bleed me of all my money?
- I never charge you a dime, Phil.
- Hey, how do I work the nitrous?
- Uh, you don't, actually.
Come on. Just one hit.
Fillings look pretty good. Any other problems?
Yeah, actually.
You're getting married in Thailand.
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph. That's two grand right there.
My mother-in-law's watching the kids. Now she's got this whole new thing to hold over my head.
Plus it takes five days to get there.
It's a 16-hour flight.
And it's beautiful when you get there.
- Whatever.
It's a hassle.
- It is kind of far. Lauren's been there a week and she's still jet-lagged.
It's where her parents are from. It means a lot.
Who gives a shit about her parents? Her dad hates you.
He doesn't hate me.
He's just never spoken to me. I think it's a cultural thing.
Why can't you get married in Vegas like last time?
So much easier. Why can't you just be excited for me?
This is my wedding. You're really happy, huh?
I really am. All right.
I'm happy too.
Thank you.
It's gonna be fun. [BOTH CHUCKLE]
Phil?
Put the prescription pad back. Thank you.
You know that's a felony, right?
Fuck you, man.
- Was this right up against your scrotum?
- Yep. TRACY:
Oh, my God. I just realized. DOUG:
What? TRACY: I forgot to renew my passport.
Oh, no. Good thing I did it last week. It's in the kitchen drawer.
You're the best. Hey, we're a team.
No, I mean, you are a good guy. Like, a really good guy.
Thank you.
So I know you're not gonna get mad. Mad? What...?
Alan found out that we're going to Thailand for Stu's wedding.
So?
So he's heartbroken, Doug. You guys are like his family.
No, your family is like his family.
All Alan talks about is the three of you.
And that weekend. Wait.
Is he the one that keeps calling and hanging up? He does that when he's upset.
He doesn't understand why he's not invited.
Could you just run it by Stu? Just run it by him.
For me? STU:
No fucking way. Absolutely not.
Come on, Stu. It's killing him.
I don't care. Honestly, the two of you were barely invited.
PHlL: Oh. - All right.
Just, you know what? Alan considers you to be one of his best friends.
I consider Alan to be insane.
PHlL: Stu, throw him a bone. His dad pays for everything he eats and breaks.
We should squeeze the old man to cover the bachelor party. That's good.
I'm glad you brought that up, because this is the bachelor party. - What?
- What are you talking about? Yeah. It's my bachelor brunch.
Go crazy. Get some chocolate-chip pancakes, a lap dance from the waitress.
That's bullshit. Ha, ha. You can't just skip out of a bachelor party, Stu.
You see that? That's orange juice with a napkin on top.
Do you know why? So nobody roofies me.
Well, I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe at a bachelor party.
Come on. Don't you think you're overreacting?
No, I don't.
I'm still putting the broken pieces of my psyche back together. [CHUCKLES]
And you know what the glue is? Lauren. And I'm not doing anything to screw that up.
- You wouldn't be with her if it wasn't for us.
- Oh, this'll be good.
Stu, think about it.
You ended up ditching Melissa. Two years later, you met your true soul mate.
You take Vegas out of that equation, you would have married a cunt. It's okay.
I'm allowed to say it. It's a bachelor party.
Drink up, everybody.
Wait, there's no alcohol.
I forgot, we're at a fucking IHOP.
Well, it's my decision and it's final, so how about a toast?
- This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Come on, Phil. Where you going?
I just don't get it.
He's getting married in Thailand. That's great for him, but what about us?
You're just selfish.
Come on, sweetheart.
Shame on you. Don't worry, Stu.
I will stand up for you no matter what.
Thank you.
But you gotta help me out with this Alan thing. SlD:
Guys, I can't tell you how much this means.
Alan's been waiting for the invite ever since he got wind of the wedding.
I'm sure he has.
Yeah, he's been standing outside by the mailbox every day.
- Wow, that's rough.
- Yeah. I, uh ... I'm not quite sure he ever left Vegas, you know?
He really needs this. [KNOCKS ON DOOR]
ALAN: What?
Sweetie, it's Pa Pa. You have visitors.
Go in slowly, give him a chance to acclimate.
DOUG: Hey, Alan.
Hey, guys.
- Hey, Phil. - Hey, bud. [STAMMERlNG]
Uh... Uh, you guys wanna come in?
- Sure. - Yeah, absolutely. - Hey.
- Hey, Stu. - Okay.
See you on the court in half... Pretty cool room, Alan.
Oh, thanks, Phil. My dad pays my rent.
Alan, what the fuck? We were supposed to delete these.
You made a promise.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell? I'm not cool with this at all. You can't have these.
PHlL: Ha, ha. - Chillax, Stu.
Nobody ever comes in here. Total violation of trust.
Mother, I'm done with my lunch. It's just sitting here. [INTERCOM BEEPS]
LlNDA [OVER INTERCOM]: Sorry, honey.
I 'il be right up. ALAN: Can't believe you stopped by.
Wait a second. Al, is that Mr. Chow? Yeah.
Stu.
- The guy that kidnapped us?
- He didn't kidnap us. He kidnapped Black Doug.
Remember? It was a whole big misunderstanding.
He's actually quite charming. [DOOR OPENS]
- Alan, he's a criminal. - Excuse me, boys.
Hi, Linda. LlNDA:
Hi, Dougie. I guess we don't do dessert any more.
I didn't get that memo. Well, I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.
Would a cupcake kill you?
- I don't think this was a good idea. - Uh, Alan, we have a little surprise for you.
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.
Well, only if you're not busy.
Stu.
Well, maybe the Jonas Brothers are in town.
No. They're in Raleigh-Durham that weekend. STU:
Mm. Are you really being serious, Stu?
You're inviting me? Yeah, why not?
Could be fun, right?
- Phil, are you going?
- Of course.
Then it will be fun. STU: Ah!
- Whoa, what the fuck are you doing, man?
It's my immunizations. This is the last day I can do it.
That's supposed to be done by a registered nurse.
I am a nurse. I'm just not registered.
Oh, Stu, look at this.
I bought this because I thought of you. STU:
Hey, there he is. - Hey, Stu.
- Teddy. What's up? How are you?
All right. - Who's this guy, Stu? This is Teddy, Lauren's little brother.
Goes to Stanford. Premed. This is Phil, Alan and Doug.
DOUG:
Hey, nice to meet you, man. - Wow, Stanford? How old are you?
TEDDY: I'm... - Uh, he's 17.
Actually, I'm 16. And I'm not a genius. My dad just had me take the entrance exams early.
Because you're a genius.
- So, what are you, a doctor? - No. Not yet.
I'm premed. Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser?  - Yeah.
- Well, he turned out to be a gay. - Alan.
- It's true. I read it in Teen People.
Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna grab a book or something for the plane.
You guys want anything?
No, thanks. DOUG: I'm good.
I would actually love a Smartwater.
Cool. Thanks.
- Whats the matter with you?
He's 16. - Yeah, Alan. Take it easy.
I'm a little confused. Is he here just to see us off or what? - How does this work?
- How does what work? Is that person coming to the wedding?  Yes, Alan.
My bride's little brother is coming to the wedding.
Is that okay with you?
Well, it's just the first time I've heard of it. You could have paged me. [DOUG SlGHS]
Don't overreact. It's gonna be fine. Hey.
Mind if I sit? - Wolf pack only. Find another chair.
- There's no wolf pack, Alan. - Come on. - It's no problem.
I can find... - Don't be ridiculous. You're sitting here.
That is a Louis Vuitton. TEDDY: Thanks.
That's a nice neck roll.
Thanks. You can use it if you want.
Okay. LAUREN; Baby!
Hi! On, my God! STU:
STU: This is so absolutely beautiful. Thank you so much.
Of course.
Between Teddy and me, you must be pretty excited. Pretty soon you'll have two doctors in the family. Ha, ha.
You have to realize that in my country, we don't consider dentist to be real doctors.
Dad.
Okay.
Anyway, I have to go and talk to Teddy about his cello performance tonight. See you.  - Ouch.
- I'm so sorry.
Your dad's kind of obsessed with your brother.
LAUREN: Teddy is my dad's prized possession. It's always been that way.
He'll warm up. I promise. Okay?
ALAN: If you just fax it over to me, I'll pick it up from concierge.
Okay. Ha, ha.
Thanks, Pa Pa. Bye-bye.
That was, uh, my dad. I'm a stay-at-home son.
We were discussing your wedding gift. He's sparing no expense.
Oh, that's so unnecessary.
I've been, uh, meaning to ask. I noticed it's a fishing village.
Is there a Long John Silver's on the island?
You know, no, I don't think so. I'm so sorry.
But we are actually sewing some great fresh seafood.
- Better than Long John's'?
- Yes.
I'll be the judge of that. Enjoy your evening.
You too.
Okay. [PLAYlNG BACH'S "SUlTE NO. 1 IN G"]
Thank you, Teddy.
The hands of a brilliant musician... and one day, a great surgeon.
I admit it.
When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold. [STU SNlCKERS AND ALL CHUCKLE]
He seemed unattractive.
He lacked intelligence and imagination.
He was missing that spark you look for in a man.
But then I look into Stu's eyes.
He reminded me of my sweet brother, Chaiyo. For those who do not know...
Chaiyo is learning-disabled and lives in a group home. [ALAN LAUGHS]
But Chaiyo loves chok.
And that's when I realized... [INAUDlBLE DlALOGUE]  Stu is chok.
[WHlSPERS] What's chok?
Chok is soft white rice in lukewarm water.
It has no taste.
We feed it to small baby and very old people.
It is nourishment that everyone can digest.
The world needs chok. Just as the world needs people like Stu.  To my sweet daughter and Stu.
Congratulations.
PHlL: Hear, hear. DOUG:
And now I believe that Teddy has something to say. Sit down.
I got this. Sit down, boy.
That was, uh, a great speech, sir.
I like the comparisons between, uh, Stu and rice.
I've also prepared a few words.
"Hey, everybody, here are some fun facts."
The population in Thailand is 63 million people.
It is twice the size of Wyoming.
Its chief exports are textiles, footwear and rice.
Each year, approximately 13,000 people are killed in car accidents in Thailand.
- The climate in Thailand is..." DOUG: Alan, uh...
Alan, why don't you skip to the last card there, buddy? Okay. Sorry.
"None of you know Stu like I do."
Not you. Not you. Not you.
Not nobody knows Stu like I do. No one.
"I can't even tell you what we've been through..." because we made a pact more important than blood.
What I can tell you is this:
This is not Stu's first marriage.
"There was a whore in Las Vegas a couple of years ago..."
[WHlSPERS] All right, time's up. You can sit down, bud.
I did good, though. - Oh, God, you killed it. - Okay.
In your face. Well, that was exactly as painful as I expected it to be.
Ha, ha.
Sorry. Oh, rice pudding!
What are you doing? - Ha, ha, ha. Very funny, Phil.
- Be nice, Phil. He's extra sensitive tonight.
Get over it. He's your father-in-law. He's supposed to hate you.
Come have a drink with me and the guys.
You know, I'm really exhausted. We're just gonna go upstairs and crash.
I spoke with the manager. He'll let us have a beach bonfire.
That sounds fun. Nah. I'm good.
He's tired.
Stu. One drink with your friends. They came all this way.
- I just wanna hang out with you. - Oh, come on, just go and do me a favor:
Take Teddy with you. He never gets to have any fun.
That is a great idea. Bring the kid. - All right.
One drink. LAUREN: Perfect.
STU: See you later. LAUREN:
STEPHANlE: Got your key? - Uh, yep.
Got it right there. - I'll see you in 20 minutes. - [MOUTHS]
My Uncle Roger said that he once saw a albino polar bear.
Really? Polar bears are white. How would he know if it's an albino?
This one was black. Did you ever think maybe it was just a black bear?
Whatevs.
- Okay. Here we go. DOUG:
- American beer. DOUG: Let's do it.
Sealed bottles. Thank you. All right.
Um, I'm not really old enough to drink. Yeah, it's illegal.
Be a shame if somebody reported you.
Nobody's reporting anybody. It's fine, Teddy. Have a little fun.
ALAN: Careful. PHlL:
What is this? Roasting marshmallows? Nice touch.
DOUG: That was Alan's idea. - Oh.
You know, I gotta hand it to you, Stu.
This place is paradise.
Not bad, right?
And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually jealous of you.
I mean, Lauren is an angel. Yeah, she really is amazing.
Wow, you guys are sweet.
Not big breasts on her, but still, solid rack for an Asian.
Sorry, Teddy, but it's true. That's okay.
That is just wildly inappropriate.
And yet I'm really glad you're here. All you guys.  Even you, Alan.
It means a lot that you made the trip. Thank you.
Wouldn't miss it, buddy. Great.
Now can we have our one fucking beer, Dad? Mm-hm.
All right. Toast.
Come on, stand up, guys.
Come over here, Alan.
To Lauren and Stu. - You did it, buddy.
- You sure did. ALL:
Cheers. [GROANS]  What the hell?
[COUGHS] [SlGHS]  [PEOPLE SHOUTlNG NEARBY]
What? ALAN: No.
Phil?
I think it's happened again.
Alan, what the fuck did you do? I didn't do anything. I swear to God.
Your hair is gone. No, no.
UP... [ALAN CHUCKLES]  Where the fuck are we?
[THUD] [ELECTRlCITY POWERlNG DOWN]  [WHlSPERS]
Phil, I'm scared. [MOANlNG NEARBY]  [GROANS]
Stu, come on, get up. We got a situation. [STU MOANlNG LOUDLY]
Oh, holy shit. Where are we?  Oh, my God, Alan.
Your head.
No, your head.
He's bald. Stu, you're gonna freak out, but it's gonna be okay.
Why? What's...? Is it my teeth?
- Are you sure? - Yep.
- Did you check the bottoms? - I did. Oh, my God.
What the fuck? Ow! That's good.
Why don't you try to wash it off? STU: It's not coming off!
This is a real tattoo!
Alan, what did you do? Did you roofie me? - I didn't do anything.
- Stu, he swore to God. What happened?
[MONKEY SCREECHlNG] [ALL YELLlNG]  PHlL:
What is it?! What is it?! Help!
- Oh, what the hell?! - Oh, it's a monkey.
Look at the cute little vest. Hi, little monkey. Alan.
Alan. Butthole.  [CHATTERlNG]
- Phone. - Hi, monkey. Look, Alan, Alan, go find the phone.
I got it. Doug.
Doug. Where the hell are you? I'm at breakfast.
You guys coming down or what? Oh, Jesus.
Thank God. Doug's fine.
Stu, Doug's fine! He's at the resort. Why aren't we at the resort?
What's going on? Where are you?
I don't know, man. We woke up in some shithole room in some city.
DOUG: Oh, God. What city?
Fucking Asia Town. I don't know.
I told you. Where are we?  PHlL:
ALAN: Hey, Stu. - What?
Check this out.
You ever seen anything like this? What is that?
ALAN: Careful! Might be a spider's nest.
I've tangled with those before. I don't get it, man.
I mean, we each had one beer last night, right?
- I mean, you too.
- Yeah, but I left early, remember? PHlL:
I don't remember shit.
Tracy wasn't feeling well. She came down to get me. Wait a second.
Is Teddy with you guys? PHlL: Teddy?
They've been looking for him all morning.
- Teddy went to Stanford, right? DOUG: Yeah.
Fuck! [PANTlNG]
I just found his finger. DOUG: What?
I just found his fucking finger, Doug. Phil, what is going on?  [STAMMERlNG]
All right. All right, all right, all right. This is what we're gonna do.
Tell the girls that we woke up early... and went on a fishing trip. That's where we are.
- Right. - All right, stay by the phone. Shit!
PHlL:
All right, we got a little bit of a problem. What is that?
We don't know.
Is it a worm? It's a mushroom.  Yeah, shiitake.
Monkey, taste it.
What do you think? Is it shiitake?
He can't understand you. STU:
He just did.
Why is he pulling on it? He's probably hungry.
Wait a second. Is that...? CHOW:
Aah! What the fuck, man?!
Tell that gay monkey to leave my shit alone!
Chow'?! CHOW:
You fucking crazy.
Ah, so fucking light in here. Alan.  Grab me my sunglasses.
- It's great to see you, Leslie. - Mm. Nice to see you too, my little hobo.
Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?
Alan called me a few days ago and invited me to wedding. - Excuse me?
- What?
He's my plus one.
You didn't have a plus one. It's $200 a plate. Guys, guys.
Just focus, okay? Chow, what happened?
You guys texted me, said you fucked up and looking to party.
[BOTH LAUGHlNG] I picked you up in my boat and I brought you here to Bangkok.
And we had a sick night, bitches!
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, Chow.
Holler! City of squalor!
Do you know how I got this tattoo? Uh, yeah. From a fucking tattoo guy.
Come on, Stewie. Use that big Jewish brain.
Hey, what's the monkey holding? [STU GASPS]  That's a finger!
PHlL: Stu, I got some bad news.
Teddy was with us last night. That's his finger.  Teddy...
Teddy's dead? Ha, ha. Teddy not dead.
Well, then where is he? Don't you remember anything?  - No!
- No. Nothing, Chow. Okay, okay.
I explain it all, okay?
Just let me do one bump, get my head straight.
Come to papa. - Okay.
- That's a big... You ready for craziest fucking story of...
Chow.
Mr. Chow, are you okay?
You gotta be kidding me.
Fuck, he's dead.
[SCREAMlNG] - Help!
- Stu. - Help! Help!
- Stu, shut up. Stu, shut up. Stu, shut up!
- Call an ambulance! PHlL: Shut up!
Look, if someone comes and finds a dead body and a pile of cocaine... we'll spend the rest of our lives in a Thai prison.
Alan, please stop crying. [SNORTS]  All right.
All right! I just need a second to figure this out.
STU:
This is the worst idea ever. What the fuck is this place?
ALAN:
"Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
Its population is 12 million people."
Alan, put the cards away and help. [MONKEY CHATTERlNG]  Elevator.
ALAN: I'll get the button. I'll get the button.
What the fuck is the deal with this monkey? ALAN: That monkey gets it.
- Oh, fuck. No, the power's out.
- We gotta take the stairs. - Ah, fuck!
Come on. Here it is.
Feet first, feet first.
I've done this before. STU: Alan.
Careful. Careful. [ALL PANTlNG]
STU: What? We still have to find Teddy.
Oh, God. The roof!
- Teddy!
- Teddy! - Teddy! Teddy!
Teddy! ALAN; Teddy!  - You guys see anything?
- No. Come on. Where are you, buddy?
He's not here. I can't believe this is happening again.
Okay.
Look, we'll handle this. You get back there.
You tell them that Alan and I got drunk with him, we're still partying.
- You gotta go get married.
- No, no. I'm not going back without Teddy.
It's Lauren's little brother, he's lost, he's injured. If I fuck this up...
I lose everything. Okay.
All right.
Alan, check your pockets.
- What? - You know the drill.
Come on, there might be clues. - Check your phones.
Numbers, texts. - Oh, that's a good idea. - I got nothing.
- Me neither. - I got a text from Chow. - What time?
Uh, 10:00 last night. What's it say?
"On my way, niggas." Oh, niggas. Okay.
Hip-hop.
We are so fucked.
- Hey, Phil. - What? Look who's back.
Hi. We gotta get you out of the sun.
Get you a hat. Yeah. Yeah.
Phil, I really think we should go to the American Consulate. PHlL: For what?
Report a dead body we shoved into an ice machine?
Are we gonna keep walking in circles? That's real productive. I'm trying to figure this out.
Your attitude is not helping. Well, I'm sorry.
It's 100 degrees and we don't have a plan.
And all we've done is buy him hats and sodas. What?
It's a bag of Fanta. - All right, what do you wanna do, Stu? - I don't know.
- Then stop yelling at me like it's my fault.
[CELL PHONE RlNGlNG]
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch. Shit. Shut up, it's Doug.
Talk to me. Just got off the phone with Bangkok P.D.
They got him. He's okay. Oh.
Thank God. Doug found him. - What happened?
DOUG: He got arrested. - Arrested?
For what? - Disorderly conduct. - Seriously?
Yeah. He's okay, though. They'll release him to you, no questions asked.
No one here has to know.
He's at the, uh... "Ratchawang Police Station."  Okay.
Okay, I'll call you when we get there. - Teddy's in jail, but fine.
We gotta get a cab. - Okay.
All right. OFFlCER:
Yes, I have his paperwork here. PHlL: Okay.
He has been cleared. PHlL: Sounds good.
We're good, we're good.
They're processing for release. [STU CHUCKLES]  Yeah, they threw him in the drunk tank.
He's fine. Sixteen years old, spent a night in jail.
Can you imagine? [ALAN CHUCKLES]  We love to party.
Here we go.
- Wait, who's this fucking guy?
- Teddy Srisai. What...? No, no, no.
I'm so... It's the wrong guy. Sir.
Uh, there's been a mistake. He brought the wrong guy. That's not Teddy.
We have his IDs and everything. These were in his pockets when we made the arrest.
They were in his pocket?
Excuse me, sir.
How did you get this stuff? Hello?
OFFlCER: Teddy doesn't speak.
We tried English, Thai, Chinese. Nothing. Let me ask you something.
Does he look like he works out at Bally Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?
Look, we arrest a lot of people. We cannot analyze everything. All right?
Well, what do you expect us to do with this guy? Not my problem.  Hey, guys?
I think he knows us. Hi.
Hello. Do you know where our friend is?!
Teddy! He's missing! Stu, forget it.
The guy's worthless. He knows something. He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.
What if he just doesn't understand?
Uh, I'll act it out. Yeah, like charades.
Watch. - Two words.
- Is it a movie? This is not for you, Alan.
American teenager in Asia.
Karate Kid with Jaden Smith. It's easy because you were talking through it.
Stu, it's a waste of time.
Just leave this fucking guy here. Oh, here's something.
"There are 500,000 monks living in Thailand."
It is not uncommon for some monks to take a vow of silence... "at the age of 8." There you go.
- Is there anything else in that envelope?
- No, it's empty. Whoa, hang on.
A drink card from White Lion Bar, Bangkok? Worth a shot.
PHlL: Jesus Christ.
Ls this the right street? STU: That's what it says.
[PHlL COUGHS] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is the White Lion.
What the fuck happened here? Holy shit.
[MAN SHOUTlNG IN THAl] PHlL: Oh, okay.
Just keep walking. Yeah. STU:
STU: What the fuck is going on here?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys, check it out.
Holy shit. Stu, look. That's my face.
Go, go, go. Nice work, Alan.  PHlL:
Hello? - Be with you in a minute. Excuse me.
Oh, look who it is.
So, what do you think? What? I'm sorry?
The tattoo? You love it? Uh, no.
No refunds. Get the fuck out. - Wait a second.
- Read the sign.
We don't want a refund.
We just have a couple of questions.
Trying to figure out what went down last night.
"What went down"?
Look what you did outside. Half the neighborhood went down.
We did that?
You don't remember getting into a bar fight at the White Lion?
Starting a full-on fucking riot? No, sir. We don't remember anything.
Hold this. Oh, boy.
Check this out. [PEOPLE SHOUTlNG AND SlRENS WAlLING ON PHONE]  Holy shit.
[YELLlNG] Fuck the police!
Fuck the police! [LOUD BANG]  [YELLlNG]
There's Teddy. He was with us. PHlL:
Jesus Christ.
That's when the cops arrived, started cracking skulls.
I took you guys and hid you in the shop here.
Then you decided to get a tattoo.
Cried like a little bitch.
This kid's fucking 9 years old. He's got balls twice your size.
- Show him your balls, man.
PHlL: No, no, no. That's okay.
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy. Have you seen him?
Not since last night. What happened?
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister tomorrow and we kind of lost him. Oh, well.
Then fuck it.
What do you mean, "fuck it"?
Bangkok has him now and she'll never let him go.
You hear that? Huh?
- Is this what you wanted? Happy now? ALAN:
You're wasting your time.
These monks take their vow shit seriously.
Look at this.
That's the sign of the Chiang Mei monastery just outside of town.
Maybe somebody over there can get him to talk. [THAI POP MUSlC PLAYlNG ON RADlO]  Can we just go over this one more time?
You got the beer from...?
The hotel bar. They gave me a sealed case. - Right.
But who gave it to you? - The bartender. Right.
And then you brought them out and I opened them.
Yeah, and Doug had one and he was fine, so it's not the beer. STU:
So, what the hell happened?
PHlL: I have no idea.
Hey, guys.
Check it out, he's got a Chinese boner.
Alan, come on. Cut it out. [ALAN LAUGHlNG]
Come on, that is so wrong. Hey, don't stop, monkey, keep doing it.  [ALL LAUGHlNG]
When a monkey nibbles on a penis, it's funny in any language. Oh, keep doing it!
All right. Thank you. We good?
ALAN: Bye, Shannon. Bye, Lil Wayne.
PHlL: Wow.
So beautiful.
What is this, a P.F. Chang's? STU:
Ah, they're meditating.
- Such a peaceful people. PHlL: Yeah.
Knock, knock! Hello?! PHlL:
Don't get up, guys. We brought one of your guys back.  He's really funny.
He's really nice and cool.
Hi, how you doing? Uh, are you the one in charge? [PHlL GRUNTS]
- Hey! Aah!
- Excuse me. Ow! Wait!
Hold on! Ah! "It's because" Ow!
Ah! Stop talking.
Goddamn it! Don't! Stop!
Oh, I get it. [GRUNTS]
[WHlSPERS] No talk. No talk.
Late last night, you climbed the walls of our monastery... shouting out question about love, marriage and the meaning of life.
Poor Brother Han was meditating alone in the garden and you took him.
Oh, my God.
We kidnapped a monk.
Uh, we live an alternative lifestyle.
And we are so sorry about that, but we weren't ourselves last night.
Yup, things kind of spun out of control a little bit. But there's a boy who's missing and hurt.
Can you find out if he knows where our friend is?
Brother Han took a vow of silence many years ago.
It would be useless to try.
Well, maybe he can write down what happened on a piece of paper.
Actually, that would be cheating. Right, Grand Wizard?
- Alan.
- I'm afraid Fatty is right.
See? What?
None us will ever know what Brother Han knows.
Oh, all right.
So much for holy people. Bunch of bald assholes. Come on, let's go.
Hey, you know what? FYl, you may wanna put some signs up that say "no talking"... before you unleash your dragon. STU:
Yeah, that was a little rough.
You're welcome for bringing him back safe.
You know, we found him in a drunk tank. STU: We did take him in the first place.
PHlL: Come on, guys, let's go. Wait.
The Buddha teach:
Every memory lives somewhere deep within.
Perhaps you should bring your question to the garden of meditation.
- Did you understand a word he said? - About two-thirds.
Something about the garden of meditation?
No, he said he's farting because of his medication.
I get that. [WHlSPERlNG]
This is a waste of time. I don't remember anything. Do you?
No. I got nothing. Alan?
Alan? [ECHOlNG]  LU:
Every memory lives somewhere deep within.
SlD: Sweetie? ALAN:
What? SlD: You have visitors.
- Hey, Alan.
- Hey, guys. - Hey, Phil. - Hey, buddy.
- Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.
- Is this true, Stuart? Yeah, why not? It'll be fun.
- What the fuck?
PHlL: To Lauren and Stu. ALL:
PHlL: Chow? CHOW:
Alan, what the fuck? [ALAN CHUCKLES]
ALAN: Ls that person coming to the wedding?
STU: There is no wolf pack. PHlL:
"The population in Thailand is ..." And we're the three best friends That anybody could have.  MAN:
Fuck the police! Fuck the police! I know where to go.
What do you think, Alan? Uh, this is the place.
Come on, let's go. [DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG ON SPEAKERS]
I don't remember any of this.
Yeah, Alan, are you sure this is the place? Yeah, pretty sure.  Bros, finally!
Is he coming or what?
I've been waiting all day for him.
Uh, I'm sorry. Waiting for who? Chow, that dick-ass fuck.
- Why, what's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing's wrong.
Okay, good. Look at this.
Look what I bring for him. Check it out, huh? Huh?
- No, no, no. - $6000, American.
Wow, it looks so real. [ALL SCREAMlNG]  Sorry.
Ahem.
Sorry. Alan! What the fuck?!
It's okay! It's okay. The gun, very sensitive.
- Everybody okay? DANCER: Yeah, okay.
Okay? Then get the fuck back to work! Come on!
Who has my $6000?
No, no, no. That's Chow's deal. We got nothing to do with that.
Un-fucking-believable, man.
This guy, if he backs out again, this shit is gonna catch up to him, okay?
He's made a lot of enemies in this town and now they're your enemies.
That's not fair!
Okay, listen. We're just looking for a little kid.
- Two thousand dollars. - What?!
I don't know. Maybe more. How young you want this kid to be?
No! No, no, no. Sorry.
We're looking for our friend, 16 years old, Teddy?
Teddy?
Yeah, he was here with you guys last night. He was?
You remember if he left with us?
You were in the corner all night with Kimmy.
I didn't see you leave. Kimmy?
Kimmy? Is she here? Yeah, she's in the back.
She just came for her shift. Go talk to her.
Listen, I'm sorry about everything that happened.
Pay attention what I'm gonna talk to you now.
When you see Chow, you tell him Samir says hello.
- Okay.
- But do it like that, okay? Hello. Like threatening.
- Hello. - Okay. - Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello. - More O. Hello.
Hello. Go away, go away. Fucking make me crazy.
Of course I remember him. He was buying shots for everyone.
Nice kid. His parents must be so proud.
Yeah. You have no idea.
Okay, so do you remember if he left with us?
Yeah, you all were leaving together, but you almost forgot this one right here.
- Right, superstar? - Hmm.
This one was following me around like a little puppy dog all night.
Saying how he fall in love with me and ask me to marry him. [PHlL AND ALAN CHUCKLE]
Classic Stu.
- We didn't get married, did we? - Of course not.
We just had some fun in the Chardonnay Room.
What, uh... What happens in the Chardonnay Room? Let's just stay on task here.
Oh, you know. Dance for him. He tickle me.
We had sex. - I massage his shoulders.
- Fuck! It's okay. You're not married yet.
It's no big deal. It's cheating, okay?
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.
It's a violation of my moral code.
Don't be sad. Stu, you love it.
You were crying, saying how special it was.
Wait. Ha, ha. I'm sorry, he was crying?
He was crying. You should have seen him. He was so sexy, the way he move around.
I had to ask him slow down so I don't drop my load too quick. Load?
What load? Oh, you know. My sperms.
Eh, I think your English is off. You're talking about my sperms.
Where would your sperm come from? From my balls.
Hold on. Back up. Wait, wait.
You in Bangkok, sweetie.
There's a reason they don't call it Bangcunt. STU: Oh!
[STU GROANS] Oh, my God.  PHlL:
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?
Come on, Stu. It was beautiful. We climaxed at the same time.
How's that work?
Shoot my load into you, you shoot your load on the floor. - Okay.
- [WHlMPERlNG] You shot your load in me? In my bottom?
[STU GROANlNG] Oh, God.  [STU MOANlNG]
Stu, it's not the end of the world. I'm sorry, but I am so confused.
I made love to a man with boobies.
Listen, I promise you no one's ever gonna find out about this.
But we just found out about it.
And then we forget. That's what we do.
I've done so much fucked up shit, and I just forget about it.
- You have? - Yeah. You just forget.
That might be harder to go away, but in time it'll happen.
That's what I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna forget about it.
- Never happened. - Right. [CELL PHONE RlNGlNG]
Phone. Phone. Who is it?
Answer. Lauren's dad.  It just reminded me.
- Answer it.
- I can't. He might know something about Teddy. We still have a shot.
- [WHlNING] I can't. - Get your head back into the fucking game.
- Hello?
FOHN: Who takes an all-day fishing trip... the day before a wedding?
Yeah, ha, ha. I guess it was kind of stupid. Put Teddy on the phone.
- Uh, Teddy's seasick, actually. FOHN: Seasick?
Teddy's been a maritime deck cadet since he was 9. Well, that's weird, because he's puking everywhere.
I'm gonna tell you something that you did not know.
I don't like you. - Yeah, I knew that already.
FOHN: My daughter chooses you... that's her problem.
Hey, it's Phil Winnick.
Listen, I apologize. We've been reeling in some crazy marlin, and I just want... [GRUNTS]
ALAN: Phil! STU:
PHlL: Fuck me. Give us back our monkey.
Come on, you asshole. The fucking monkey.
Come on.
Any time, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us.
This is our monkey.
Alan, no one's getting shot over a fucking monkey.
Hand him over now.
Oh, God, I never get to keep no monkeys.
[MEN SPEAKlNG IN RUSSlAN]
Hey, check it out. He's got a banana on his helmet. - These guys are the real deal.
What's happening? Hold on. How did this happen?
Do you know where our friend is? Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, 16 years old, Asian kid?
[SPEAKlNG IN RUSSlAN] No, I don't understand what he said.
What did he say?
What did he say?!
He said, "Fuck you and your question." [YELLS]
PHlL: Oh, my arm! Poor Phil!
PHlL: Oh, I got shot. Fuck!
Fuck, guys. It's all right, Phil.
We'll figure this all out and get the monkey back.
I promise. No one gives a fuck about the monkey, Alan!  Oh, shit, look at my arm.
What the fuck is going on?! Stu, am I gonna be okay? You're a doctor.
I don't know. Let me look, let me look. [SCREAMS]
What? What?
Stu, come here. No, look at it.
Stuart Price, get your ass back over here!
STU: You got shot! PHlL:
PHlL: Hey. - Yo.
I'm okay. Actually, bullet just grazed my arm. Eight stitches.
Only cost $6. How's that even possible?
How's any of this even possible?
I mean, if I was a foot to my left, Stu, I'd be dead.
What are we gonna do? I'm sorry, guys.
This wasn't part of the plan.
What plan, Alan? I've said too much already.  Alan, what plan?
This is all Teddy's fault. PHlL: What are you talking about, Alan?
Why is he here? He's not part of the wolf pack.
Alan, what did you do? It's not my fault.
Teddy shouldn't have been sharing from his bag.
What bag? The marshmallows.
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.
But it was dark, it was hard to keep track, and then you almost sat on them.
I couldn't tell which was which. It was mayhem. What did you do to the marshmallows, Alan?
Alan? What did you do?
Well, isn't it obvious?
I spiked them with muscle relaxers.
And, plus, my ADHD medication.
- What?! - You drugged us again?!
Not you.
I just wanted to knock out Teddy so we could enjoy the weekend.
"Enjoy the weekend"'?
Alan, you told me that you didn't do anything.
Alan, you swore to God.
I just wanted things to stay the same.
Look at my face! You ruined my life!
You're not my friend.
Don't say that, Phil. Are you serious? Even in America?
- Yes! - [CRYlNG] Oh, God.
Don't say that, Phil. Don't start crying, Alan.  You're the bearded devil!
You liked it. You smiled at me when I held up the marshmallows.
Because I like marshmallows, you fucking psycho!
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, hold on! Stop!
- Guys, guys.
Enough. - Why?! Why, Alan?!
Why?! Because we're the three best friends, remember?
Remember?
Stu, that's enough. That's enough. Fuck.
[ALL PANTlNG] Guys, we can't fall apart now. We gotta stick together.
- Alan, what's that written on your belly? - What?
Huh? "Lebua Hotel. Saturday, 6 p.m."
Did you write that? No.
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.
What about England?
Are we friends there? I told you, it was in the heat of the moment.  We're still friends, all over the world.
- Even Great Britain? - Yeah. Mm-hm.
Well, what about you, Stu?
We'll see.
Gentlemen, follow me. All right.  MAN:
Here you go. KlNGSLEY:
Well.
It's about time.
Sit down. - Come on, sit, sit, sit. - Okay.
Wow, you guys look like shit. PHlL:
Uh, do we know you?
- Hey. Take off your fucking hat. You're in a restaurant, for chrissake.
Okay, listen. Uh, we have no clue what's going on here.
You know, they sell a plum whiskey here. It's fucking unreal.
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up. [CHUCKLES]  Oh, I'm sorry, you guys already got fucked up, didn't you?
[CHUCKLES] Uh, listen. I'm a little confused.
How did you...? Yeah, you know what?
I'm a little fucking confused. Where's Chow?!
Where is Chow with the fucking account code and the fucking password?! We don't know anything about any codes.
We're just trying to find our friend.
- Teddy. - Yes. Teddy.
Hmm. Let's see. Oh.
There's Teddy.
PHlL: Holy shit. It's from last night.
Who are you?
I'm a businessman... and I have invested a large chunk of capital in your friend Chow.
And in return, he was supposed to transfer our profits electronically... about five fucking minutes ago.
So last night, we took Teddy as insurance.
Oh, my God. Is he okay? [MOCKlNGLY]
You tell Chow... that we are having breakfast on the roof of this hotel tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.
Now, if he makes the transfer, you will get Teddy.
If not, well, then, hey, you know? It's Bangkok.
That's your cue to get the fuck out of here. [KlNGSLEY CHUCKLES]
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.
Alan, leave the hat.
Attaboy. [ELEVATOR BELL DlNGS]
We're fucked. Chow's dead.
What do we do now? The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow. This whole thing's about a bank account.
[PHlL SlGHS] Let's just go back to the hotel, Search Chow's body.
And hopefully the password's in his wallet or something.
STU: What if it isn't?
I mean, they're gonna kill Teddy. Just relax. We have until 8 a.m. tomorrow to figure it out.
First the monkey, now my hat. How much worse can this day get?  [ELEVATOR BELL DlNGS]
Jesus Christ. [SlNGlNG]
Well, we're living here in Alantown. And he's driven our lives into the ground.
When we woke up We were wasted and drunk
Phil got shot. We got beaten by a monk
I was happy, and my life was good.
Getting married like a dentist should.
Roasting marshmallows on a stick
I got fucked in the ass. By a girl with a dick
[ALAN CHUCKLES] I remember that.
And we 're living here in Alantown.
STU:
There's water everywhere. Yeah, that's because it melted, Stu.
The fucking power's out. "With an inadequate electrical grid serving millions of people...  Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages per year."
PHlL: Seriously, Alan, that's enough.
Out of the way. [YELLlNG]
We got it. [ALL YELL]
ALAN: Ghost!
There's a ghost! CHOW: Motherfucker!
Chow, calm down!
Chow, calm down! - Fucking kill on me! - No, no, no.
It's okay.
Relax. [GRUNTS]  PHlL:
That's it.
It's just us.
Breathe. - Chow so cold.
PHlL: I'm gonna warm you up. Chow so cold.
Chow so cold. You did good, buddy. You did good.
PHlL: Feeling better?
You all right? You warm enough?
I don't know. Come feel my balls and tell me.
I've been locked in a fucking ice box all day.
Hey, Alan, you want my awesome sunglasses, you just ask Chow.
You don't have to kill me. Chow, nobody killed you.
You were already dead.
You didn't have a pulse. Oh, you never do blow before?
Sometime your heart stop, start up again.
Read a book. Look, I'm sorry.
We're just having a bad day. Oh, you having a bad day? Did you die?
I got shot. But did you die?
Chow, some guy told us that you've got a bank code or something... and if we don't bring it to him first thing in the morning, he's gonna kill Teddy.
Who, Kingsley? Pfft.
He harmless. Don't worry. I got the bank codes.
Great. All right, we gotta meet him at 8 a.m.
Who is that fucking guy, anyway?
Invest in my business. Yeah?
What business is that? It's called Not Your Business, okay?
So where's the monkey?
- The monkey? - Yeah. I stashed the account number and password in his vest.
Where is he? [STU GROANS]
- Why would you do that? - Safekeeping, pretty boy.
I got a lot of heat on my ass.
I got FBl, Bangkok P.D., Interpol, MSNBC.
That monkey snorting coke with me all night... jerking me off while I watch Stu fuck with ladyboy.
STU: Ugh. - He not going anywhere.
We don't have the monkey, Chow. No, some Russian thugs took him from us.
CHOW: Oh, you fucking guys.
Okay, no problem. We just have to get him back.
- From where? - Same place we took him from. This monkey isn't just normal monkey.
[HORN HONKS] [CHOW WHlSTLES]  CHOW:
Think of him like monkey drug mule.
He take coke to buyer... and deliver cash to dealer.
He middleman. Dealer never handle drug directly.
He clean. [MONKEY CHATTERlNG]
That's terrible. Not terrible. What you talking about?
It's fucking genius. You ever see monkey go to jail?
We just signal monkey for deal, he come close... we take his vest and that's that.
Maybe get some blow too. You know, just bump. No.
Okay, this is ridiculous. [BLOWS]
Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle. Signal monkey. [WHlSTLES]
- All right, here we go.
- Come on. How'd we wind up with the monkey last night?
Well, I needed some blow and Alan thought he was cute, so we stole him.
[ALAN CHUCKLES] [CHOW CHUCKLES]
So stupid.
Stu, ready to grab vest? I... Okay.
- Yeah, just do it, Stu. Just do it. - Hey, monkey!
- Fuck! CHOW: We gotta go right now.
[TlRES SQUEAL] Pull that fucking monkey in!  I'm trying!
Aah! Fuck! CHOW:
Get that monkey in here, Stu! He won't let go!
Stu, get back in the car right now!
STU: I'm trying! Slow down!
[ALAN WHlMPERlNG] He's so strong!  Let go, you fucking monkey!
[HORN HONKS] - Look out! - Aah!
I got him! I got him!
[CHOW LAUGHS] - Where's the code, Chow? - Check his little vest.
- You got it, Alan?
- Yeah, I got it, Phil. - Slow down, slow down, Chow! - Hold on, gay boys!
- Holy shit! - Fuck.
[CHOW LAUGHS] Don't worry, I got this shit.
Pig! [STU AND ALAN YELLlNG]
Oh, my word!
Ha, ha. Sorry, Stu. My bad.
Oh, shit.
Get down!
What the fuck?!
[MONKEY SCREECHlNG] Oh, no! They shot the monkey!
They shot the monkey!
I'm at my wits' end!
He's coming back around.
Look out! - Holy fuck.
- Oh, no. [ALL SCREAM]  [COUGHlNG]
[PANTlNG AND GROANlNG] PHlL: Everybody all right?
Yeah. Whoo! I have such an erection right now.
STU: Are you for real? [MONKEY WHlMPERlNG]
They're gonna take good care of you here, okay?
What's that? Oh, yeah.
Of course.
Cigarettes, got them right here. Here you go. There you go.
Deep breath. Good. Good.
Smoke it in. Breathe the smoke into your tiny little lungs.  There you go.
It's funny. I've never been much of a smoker...
[CHUCKLES] but, boy, does it look cool on you.
PHlL: Alan! Come on, let's go!
I'm gonna miss you, monkey.
I wish monkeys could Skype.
Maybe one day. [DOG BARKlNG]
PHlL: Come on, get in. ALAN:
Just to spend them with you. Are you guys seriously this calm?
Relax, Stuart. It's classic switcheroo.
I give him money, he gives us Teddy.
Ever do anything that doesn't end up in a standoff?
I'm an international criminal.
It always ends like this. I met my wife at one of these things.
[STU SCOFFS] You have a wife?  Yeah.
We married 15 years. What, Chow not good-looking enough for woman?
No, that's cool. [BELL DlNGS]
- Let's do this. - Welcome to the Tower Club. Blah, blah, blah.
Who cares? PHlL: it's okay. CHOW:
Hey, Kingsley.
- Well, well. CHOW: Propecia looking nice.
[KlNGSLEY CHUCKLES]
Whew, you been hitting the gym? Yes, I am, actually. Thank you for noticing, Chow.
Hey, guys, have a seat.
Where's Teddy? He's waiting downstairs in my car.
We'll send him up... when the transfer is complete.
CHOW: Tell you what: Give me extra 50 grand, you keep Teddy.
And I throw in this other fat fuck for free.
[KlNGSLEY, CHOW AND ALAN LAUGHlNG] Oh, jeez. Chow.
Can we move this along? Alan, account number?  Come On, Come On, Come On.
Uh, eight-one-four... K, as in "knife"... two-three-nine-eight.
Password? "Baloney1."
Your password is "baloney1"?
It used to be just "baloney."
Now they make you add number.
Really fucking annoying. Okay. [COMPUTER BEEPlNG]
[on-lucKl_Es] - And it's that easy. CHOW:
[KlNGSLEY CHUCKLES] Oh, look, you sunk my battleship.  [BOTH LAUGH]
Great. Now can we please have Teddy? Uh, yeah.
CHOW: Ha, ha. See?
We go to your wedding, we have fun, I bust a nut. PHlL: We did it, Stu.
OFFlCER: This is Bangkok Police. Everybody down.
[PEOPLE SCREAMlNG AND SPEAKlNG IN THAl] CHOW:
No! Kingsley, you're fucking 5-0?
Gotcha, Leslie.
Get him out of here. Go. Good, good!
CHOW: How the fuck...?!
Samir? You fucked me over 6 grand? You camel jockey.
You spit to me? You spit to me?
Hey, 6 grand this time, 8 grand last time.
It's not the money, man. It's the principle. Principle?
Nigga, please. We both dead inside.
You call me nigga? Huh? Don't call me nigga.
KlNGSLEY:
You guys okay? - What the fuck's going on? Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.
- You're a cop?
- Yes. This sting operation's been in place for weeks.
When Samir told us that your friend was lost... we took advantage of that information.
- I'm sorry. - Oh, no.
- So can Teddy come out of the car now? - No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fucking car.
They don't have him. They never had him.
They just needed us to bring them Chow.
They used Teddy as bait. [STU GROANS]
Do you have any leads at all? No.
We've checked everywhere, no one has seen him. I'm sorry.
If you haven't found him by now... I'm afraid Bangkok has him.  Why do people keep saying that?
Stu... it's time. Phil.
I'm sorry. [SlGHS]  Don't say that.
Please. No, this time we really fucked up.  Oh, God.
How bad? Like no wedding bad?
Yeah.
Little worse than that. I don't know what to tell you.  [BEEPlNG]
Okay, how about this? He fell off the fishing boat and drowned.
No.
Okay, I got it. Teddy was hit by a truck.
- Alan. - Not a good time, Phil. Kind of busy.
How many people get run over here? Ugh.
Over 1200 a year, Phil. Perfect.
His body was too mangled to recover. Case closed.
Can I have more ice, please?
I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.
Stu, do you want this or not? Look at what I've done, Phil.
What I do.
I have a weakness for prostitutes.
All kinds, apparently. I have a demon in me.
So what?
Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.
I'll just let her live her life without me.
Stu. I want you to call Doug and tell him I'm never coming back.
I'm getting off the hamster wheel.
I'm gonna stay here in Bangkok. I think I belong here.
Open up a little dentist office.
Teeth cleanings with a happy ending. [PHlL SlGHS]
You sure about this? Hey!
What the crud?
Power's out, Alan. [LlNE RlNGlNG]
DOUG [ON PHONE]:
Phil. - Doug. I need answers, man.
- I know, um ... - Doug, who are you talking to?
- Give me the phone.
- No, that's a private... LAUREN [ON PHONE]: Who is this?
- Lauren? Phil? Tell me what's going on right now.
PHlL: We lost your little brother.
LAUREN:
What? PHlL: Bangkok has him now.
PHlL: We gotta take the stairs.
You're in Bangkok? STU:
Ew! That's a finger!
Put Stu on the phone.
ALAN: "Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages per year."
PHlL: Stu really just doesn't wanna talk to anybody.
STU: Water. PHlL:
CHOW: Come on, Stewie. Use that big Jewish brain.
He's just not up for it ... - Phil? Phil.
Phil, give me the phone.
PHlL: it's Lauren. - I know. I need to talk to her.
- I'm handling this. I'll handle this, Stu! - You're gonna break her heart!
- Hey, sweetheart, it's me.
I'm so sorry! Stu? What the hell is going on?
What does he mean, you lost Teddy? STU: What?
No, no, no. We misplaced Teddy.
But we're all good now.
We're headed back to the resort. See you soon.
I love you so much. And I gotta go, but I'll see you soon.
Bye.
Stu! Stu...!
ALAN: Ah!
Taxi! Taxi!
Come on! Come on, Alan! Come on!
PHlL: Hey, you mind filling us in?
STU: Okay. - Now, when we woke up, the power was out.
- Yeah. And you found Teddy's finger in what?
- In a bowl of water. - But it didn't start out as water.
- It was ice.
- Exactly. Teddy got ice from the machine... came back to the room, put his finger on ice, fell asleep.
What do you do if you wake up and your finger's in a bowl of melted ice?
I'd get more ice, Stu, on the 15th fucking floor!
Yes! Teddy goes up, the power goes out ...
Holy shit. Of course. Of course, he's in the ice machine.
STU: Alan, no! It's on 10!
Sir, is the elevator stuck? [MAN SPEAKS IN THAl]
Come on. STU: Go.
Ten! This is it! Teddy!
Teddy! Teddy! PHlL:
Teddy! - He's okay! He's okay!
Hey, you okay? You okay, man?
Where am I? You're in an elevator in the middle of Bangkok.
But we're gonna get you out of here. It's gonna be fine.
TEDDY: Hey, Stu... nice tattoo. [ALL LAUGH]
STU: Thanks, man.
- All right, let's do this. Come on. Come on, come on.
PHlL: Doug, we found him. Yeah!
I know, I know, but we're on our way. Okay, bye.
All right, guests are arriving, people are starting to ask questions... but we can still pull this off.
- How? - I don't know. Like, a taxi?
- Chow's speedboat. - What?
Last thing I remember was getting off Chow's speedboat.
Chow has a speedboat? The Perfect Life.
Come on. [STU AND PHlL CHUCKLE]
Stu, get that back line.
ALAN: Good jump, Phil!
You all right?
ALAN: Yeah. You sure you know how to drive this thing?
[ENGlNE STARTS] Please. I was raised in yacht clubs.
You know where we're going?
Please address me as "captain." Oh, fuck you, Alan.
Do you know where We're going, captain?
Affirmative, cadet.
We're going south, through the Gulf of Thailand. Ha, ha. Good.
Hey. You okay?
- Feeling a little better. - All right.
Listen, Teddy, I'm really sorry. We didn't mean for any of this to happen.
It's funny.
I can't remember anything... but when I woke up... I was kind of happy.
Yeah!
By the way, you have any idea where my finger is?
Yeah, we gave it to a drug-dealing monkey.
Bangkok.
Yeah, right? Fucking Bangkok.  [PLAYlNG ELEGANT CLASSlCAL MUSlC]
I apologize!
There will be no wedding! No, he is on his way.
He will be here. Please, if you will all move to the bar.
We are going to clear this area. Please. [CHATTERlNG]
Daddy, how can you do this? I'm telling you, I spoke to him. He's coming.
LAUREN: You don't understand. Look.
[YELLlNG] Stu!  [CHUCKLES]
Alan, there's no dock.
ALAN: Just hang on. - Alan, it's not funny.
Turn the boat. - Hang on. Is that Alan driving the boat?
DOUG: What? Uh ...
We should probably move back a little bit. Come on. PHlL:
Please! Turn the boat! Turn the boat, Alan!
Turn the fucking boat!
Everyone, back up a little bit here. Sir, it's gonna get worse before it gets better. Come on, sir.
Hi. Hi, everybody.
We came in a little hotter than we planned. And sorry we trenched the lawn here.
Totally fixable.
A bit of sod, we'll be fine. - Baby!
- Oh, my God. - Hi. - Ah, I'm so happy to see you.
FOHN: Teddy. Teddy, here.
- Hi, Dad. - Oh, Teddy. - Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay. No! Your hand!
I know. We had an accident. I'm okay.
- This is your fault.
- No, Dad. He's right. Mr. Srisai, Lauren.
- I haven't been completely honest with you. - Stu? - Yeah?
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it. You said I'm chok.
Well, I'm not.
I'm not some weird milky, ricey, watery goop... that you feed to infants and old people, okay?
Maybe I would be if you added some cayenne pepper. [LAUREN CHUCKLES]
I wish I was a boring dentist who had a boring life and boring friends... but I don't, I'm not.
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.
Hey, it's not weird. It's pretty cool, actually.
No membership fee... I have heard enough of this.
You come here. Whoa.
Here's the deal, man.
I got a dark side.
There's a demon in me.
It's true, he has semen in him.
I said "demon."
But you also have semen in you. Remember? That's not relevant, but thank you, Alan.
Point is... this demon takes me to some pretty weird places.
And we lost Teddy for two days in Bangkok.
But that same demon took us to hell and back to find him.
We took on Bangkok and we won.
And that's pretty fucking cool if you ask me. Right?
I love your daughter and I'm gonna marry her... unless you have any problem with that.
- All right.
But all that said... it would actually mean a great deal to both of us... if we could just get your motherfucking blessing. [ELEGANT CLASSlCAL MUSlC PLAYlNG]  Hey, Alan.
Your head looks pretty cool shaved. ALAN:
Thanks, Phil. You should shave your head too.
Why would I do that? Well, that way, we would look exactly alike.  Take good care of my daughter, Stu.
- I will. - Thank you. [WHlSPERlNG]
I'm sorry we almost killed everyone with the boat.
Just happy you're here.
Don't worry about the tattoo.
I'll have it lasered as soon as we're home in L.A. It's okay. I can get used to it.
- But for now, let's switch sides?
- Yeah, okay. Thank you.
Much better.
Dear family and friends... on behalf of Stu and Lauren...
I welcome all of you for this marriage celebration.
We are here today to encourage, celebrate ... [SlNGlNG A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS' "I RAN"]  I walk along the avenue
I couldn't get away. Thanks, buddy.

Um, I want to thank the Asiatic people for allowing us in your land.
I wanted to, um, say that, um, I'm really happy to be here... and I have a wedding gift to present to Lauren and Stu.

And if you're lucky, then the god's a she Alan!
I can feel the devil walking next to me.

How did you do that?
My dad had to make a lot of calls, and then I told Mike, I said: "You gotta do it. It's for my third best friend."
STU: Alan, it's amazing. I love it.
Thank you so much. We only have him for the night. We don't own him permanently.
Understood. One night in Bangkok Makes the hard man humble.  Not much between despair and ecstasy
[ALL CHUCKLE] Mike, you were great.  STU:
It's true, that was incredible. Thanks, guys. Thank you.
That means a lot. Really, it does. By the way, you really need to remove that fucking tattoo from your face.
Yep. On it.
Sorry about the last-minute performance change.
- Don't worry.
- What are you talking about?
Well, he was supposed to sing "Burning Up" by the Jonas Brothers... but then I remembered you don't like indie rock.
Hey, guys. You're not gonna believe this.
- Is that your phone?
- Yeah.
How come you never tried calling us?
It's been dead for two days. But I recharged it and found all these photos.
- What? - Oh, shit.
Some of it's pretty messed up. - Awesome. Let's check them out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No one needs to see this stuff. Come on, man. I'm Mike Tyson.
I've seen everything. - It'll be fine. - What...?
All right. But we look at it once... And then we delete them.
It's gonna be okay. [STU YELLS]  Motherfucker.

You root for your favorite, you crywhen they get killed.
It's sick. Gale.
If no one watches...
Then they don't have a game.It's as simple as that.
What?
Nothing.
Fine, laught at...
I'm not laughing at you.
We could do it, you know?
Take off. Live in the woods.What we do anyway?
They'd catch us.
Maybe not.
Cut out our tongues or worse.
We wouldn't make it five miles.
No, I get five miles.
We'll go that way.
I have Prim. You have your brothers.
They can come too.
Prim in the woods?
Maybe not.
I'm never having kids.
Not might.
If I don't live here.
But you do live here.
I know, but if I didn't.
Oh, I forgot.
Here.
Oh my God!
Is this real?
Yeah. Better be.
Cost me a squirrel.

And...
May the odds be ever in your favor.
Now, before we begin.
We have a very special film.
Brought to you all theway from the Capitol.
War.
Terrible war.
With those...
Orphan... and motherless child.
This was the uprisingthat brought our land.
13 Districts rebel againstthe country that fed them.
Protected them.
Then came the peace.
Hard fought.
Solely won.
The people.
Rose up from the ashesand a new era was born.
The freedom has a cost.
And the traitors was defeated.
Peace-War as a nation.
We would never knowthis treason again.
And so, it was decreed...
That each year.
The various districts of Panemwould offer up in tribute...
One young man and woman.
To fight to the death.
And it peg you to honor, courage and sacrifice.
The lone victor...
Bathe in riches...
Will serve as our reminderof our generosity. .. and our forgiveness.
This is how we remember our past.
This is how we safe guard our future.
I just love that.
Now, the time has come to... ...select... ...one courageousyoung man and woman.
For the honor ofrepresenting District 12 in the 74thAnnual Hunger Games.
As usual... ...ladies first.
Primrose Everdeen!
Where are you?
Come on up.
Well, come on up!
Prim!
Prim!
No!
I volunteer!
I volunteer as Tribute.
I believe we have a volunteer.
- You need to get out of here.- No!
- Go find mom!- No!
- Prim, go find mom!- No!
I'm so sorry!
No!
Noo!
Noo! Nooo! Noooo!
In mad of turn of eventshere on District 12.
District 12's very first volunteer.Big breath.
Come on dear.
What's your name?
Katniss Everdeen.
Well, I bet my hatthat was your sister.
Wasn't it?
Yes.
Let's have a big hand for our veryfirst volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.
And now... ...for the boys.
Peeta Mellark.
Here we are.
Our Tributes from District 12.
Well, go on you two. Shake hands.
Happy Hunger Games.
And be the odds beever in your favor.
You have 3 minutes.
Prim, Prim, its okay.
Shh. Prim, I don't have much time.
Prim, listen.
You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food for money.
That doesn't worth puttingyour name in more times, okay?
Listen, Prim.
Gale will bring you game.He stuck cheese from your coat.
Just try to win.
Maybe I can, I am smart you know?
You can hunt.
Exactly.
It's to protect you.
Thank you.
You can't turn out again.
I won't
No, you can't.
Not like when dad died.
I won't be here anymore.Your all she has.
No matter what you feel, you willbe there for her.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
It's time.
It's okay. Prim, it's okay.
No! No!
I promise Prim.
I'm fine.
You don't know.
I am.
Listen to me.
You're stronger than they are.You are.
Get to a bow. What will if youshow them how good you are?
They just want a good show.That's all they want.
If they don't have a bow, then you make one.
Okay? You know how to hunt.
They're not animals.
It's no different Katniss.
There's 24 of us Galeand only one comes out.
Yeah.
And it's gonna be you.
Okay.
Take care of them Gale.
Whatever you do, don'tlet them starve.
Let's go! I'll see you soon okay?
You two haven't had trip?
Crystal chandeliers.
Platinum donuts.
200 miles per hour and youcan barely feel a thing.
I think its rather a wonderfulthing is about this opportunity...
That even though you're here and eventhough it's just for a little while.
You get to enjoy all of this.
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the back car.
You even met him?
Haymitch?
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did witness things once.
Look!
You know if you don't want to talk, I understand.
But I just don't think there's anything wrong ofgetting a little bit of help.
Congratulations.
Where's the ice?
I don't...
Okay, so uh... ...so when do we start?
Whoah.
Why so eager?
Most of you are in such a hurry.
Yeah.I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor, you're supposed to go...
Encore.
Yeah.
Our mentor is supposed to tell us howto get sponsors and give us advice.
Oh, okay.
Ummm...
Embrace the probabilityof your immanent death.
I know.
Can your heart... that there's nothing Ican do to save you.
So why are you here then?
The refreshments.
Okay, I think that's enough.
You made me spill my drink.
Over my new pants.
You know...
I think I'll go finishthis in my room.
I shouldn't have come around.
What? It's no use.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
We have two... 16 year olds.
Yes.
Do you remember this year?
Aww. One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite arenas.
The use of the rubble, the ruin city.
Very exciting.
From this moment here... ...this moment... .. is the moment thatyou never forget.
The moment... ...when a Tribute... ...becomes a victor.
You'd freeze to death first.
Because I didn't light a fire.
Now that's a goodway to get killed.
What's a good way to get killed?
Oh! Joy.
Why don't you join us?
I'm just saving a life-saving advice.
Like what?
I wa... I was just askingbout how to find shelter.
Which would come in handy ifin fact you are still alive.
How do you find shelter?
Pass the jam.
How do you find shelter?
Give me a chance towake up sweetheart.
This mentoring is very... ...tax and stuff.
Can you pass the marmalade?
That is mahogany.
Look at you!
Just killed a... place mat!
You really wanna knowhow to stay alive?
You get people to like you.
Oh!
Not what you're expecting.
When you're in themiddle of the games... ...and you're starving or freezing, some water, a knife or even somematches can mean the difference betweenlife and death.
And those things onlycomes from Sponsors.
And to get Sponsors, you haveto make people like you.
And right now, sweetheart?
You're not off to areally good start.
There it is.
It's huge.
That's incredible.
Come on.
Better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.
So now that you've seen... ...what do you think ofthis years cropful troops?
Are there any surprises thatwe can expect this year?
It's really hard to tell froma Reaping but I think... ...this is a very interesting mix.
Yes.
Whenever you have a volunteerfrom an outline district, it's something you can't ignore.
What's that?
What's that?
We were just sayingwe might need to hose you down again beforewe take you to Cinna.
That was all the bravestthing I've ever seen.
I am Cinna.
Katniss. I'm sorry that this happened to you.
And I'm here to helpyou in any way I can.
Most people just congratulate me.
I don't see the point in that.
So tonight... ...they have the Tribute Parade.
Let me take you out andshow you after the wurl.
So you're here tomake me look pretty.
I'm here to help youmake an impression.
Now usually, they dress people intheir close to their district.
Yeah. We're called minors.
Yeah. But I don't want to do that.
I'm gonna do something thatthey're gonna remember.
Did they explain abouttrying to get sponsors?
Yeah, but I'm not verygood at making friends.
We'll see.
I just think, somebody that brave... ...shouldn't be dressed up on somestupid costume as should they.
I hope not.
It's not real fire. These suits arebuilt so you won't feel a thing.
That's better on me.
The idea...
You ready?
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Over one hundredthousand people, craning to get a glimpse thisyear's Tributes... ...and the Sponsors get to seethe Tributes for the first time.
The importance of this momentcannot be over stated.
They're nice.
First cheered on my counting in 15... ...14... 13...
Here they are. Here they are.
This year's Tributes.
The most exciting run... ...it just gives you goosebumps.
Don't you love, how the stylist... ...they so clearlyare able to reflect the character of each district.
There's District 4!
Fishing.
I get it. I like it.
That's very good.
And behind them... .. we have two power plant workers.
And then... ...what is that in the background?
Come on. They'll love it.
Now see that? I love that.
Two young people, holding their hands up!
Saying, "I'm proud,I'm from District 12!
We will not be overlooked!"
I love that.
We're gonna sure we'll be payingattention to them right now!
And we're ready.
President Snow, you're live!
Welcome.
Welcome.
Tributes.
We welcome you.
We salute... ...the courage... ...and your sacrifice.
And we wish you... ...happy Hunger Games.
And may the odds beever in your favor.
That was amazing.
Oh, we are anybody'sgoing be talking about.
So brave.
Are you sure you'respinning up a new flame?
Fake flame?
Are you sure?
That's uh... ...let's go upstairs.
So each of the districtsgot their own floor and because you're from 12, you get the penthouse.
Come on.
So this is the living room.
I know!
Now, your rooms are right over here.
Why don't you go clean yourselvesup a little before dinner.
In two weeks... ...23 of you will be dead.
One of you will be alive.
Who that is dependson how well you pay attention over thenext four days.
Particularly to whatl'm about to say.
First. No fighting withthe other Tributes.
You'll have plenty of timefor that in the arena.
There are four compulsory exercises, the rest will be individual training.
My advice is...
Don't ignore the survival skills.
Everybody wants tograb a sword but most of you wil die fromnatural causes.
10% from infection.
20% from dehydration.
Exposure can kill aseasily as a knife.
Where's my knife?
Where did you put it?
I put my knife...
Don't touch me... Fuck!
You took my knife!
I didn't touch your knife.I didn't touch your kni...
You liar.
You little punk!
You took my knife.
Get off me.
Just sit here.
I should better wait for the arena.
You're the first one I getso watch your back huh!
Everybody back in line.
You know you're next to me Cato!
Busy career.
You know what that is?
From District 1. ...and 2.
They've been trying to bein a special academy till they're 18 and they volunteer.By that point... ...they're pretty lethal.
But they don't receiveany special treatment.
In fact, they're staying at theexact same apartment as you do.
And I don't think left themout for dessert and you can.
So how good all that?
Obviously, they're pretty good.
They won in almostseveral year but...
Almost...
They can be arrogant.
And arrogance canbe a big problem.
I hear you can shoot..
I'm alright.
Actually, better than alright.
I fed her by the squirrels.
He say she hits em rightin the eye, everytime.
- Peeta's strong.- What?
He can throw a 100pound sack of flour right in his head.
I've seen it. Okay, well I cannot killanybody by a sack of flour.
No, you might have abetter chance at winning when somebody comesafter you with a knife.
I have no chance of winning.None! Alright?
It's true.
Everybody knows it.
You know what my mother said?
She said, "District 12 mightfinally have a winner!"
But she wasn't talking about me.
She was talking about you.
I'm not very hungry.
I'm done too.
Throw that metalthing over there.
What?
No.
Haymitch says we're notsupposed to show...
I don't care what Haymitch said.
Those guys are looking atyou like you're a meal.
Throw it.
Hi.
Hey.
How did you do that?
I uh...
I used to take care of thecakes down at the bakery.
I'll show you.
See?
Wow.
Yeah.
I think you have a shadow.
Tomorrow.They will bring you in one by one.
And evaluate you.
This is important because highratings will mean Sponsors.
This is the time toshow them everything.
There'll be a bow, make sure you use it.
Peeta, you make sureto show your strength.
They'll start with District 1so the two of you will go last.
Not on my house to put this...
Make sure they remember you!
Katniss Everdeen.
Hey Katniss.
Shoot straight.
Katniss Everdeen.
District 12.
Thank you.
For your consideration.
Are you crazy?
I just got mad.
Mad?!
You realize that your actionsreflect badly on all of us.
Not just you.
They just want a goodshow, it's fine.
How bout just bad manners Cinna?
How bout that?
Well, finally!
I hope you notice, wehave a serious situation.
Nice shooting sweetheart!
Wha.. Wha... What did they...
What did they do whenyou shot the apple?
Well, they look pretty startled.
What did you say... "Thanks for..." ...consideration.
Genius!
Genius.
How do you think you'regonna find this funny?
If the game makers decidedto take it out...
On who? On her?
On him?
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset and have a drink.
I would have givenanything to see it.
As you know the Tributesare rated on a scale of 1 to 12 after three daysof careful evaluation.
The game keepers wouldlike to evaluate...
From District 1, Marvel.
The score of 9.
Cato, the score of 10.
Clove, the score of 10.
Four, score of...
From District 7...
From District...
Rue, the score of 7.
From District 12...
Peeta Mellark...
The score of... 8.
Not bad. Bravo.
And finally...
From District 12...
Katniss Everdeen...
With the score of...
...eleven.
Congratulations.
I thought they hated me.
They must have like you girl.
To Katniss Everdeen...
The Girl On Fire!
At eleven?
She earned it.
She shot an arrow at your head.
Well, t'was an apple. ...near your head.
Sit down.
Seneca... ...why do you think we have a winner?
What do you mean?
I mean... ...why do we have a winner?
I mean if we justwanted to intimidate the Districts, why not round up 24 of them at random and executethem all at once.
Hope.
Hope?
Hope.
It is the only thing... stronger than fear.
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.
It's track is fine..As long as it's contained.
So...
So... contain it!
Right.
If she's staring at all my jewels, she can't take her eye from...
Frankly... it was rude.
Oh, Haymitch.You should join us.
We're having some ofyour favorite dish.
Oh, lovely.
Where's Peeta?
He's in his room. Now listen...
Tomorrow's the last day.
When they let us walk withour own Tributes right before the game so you andI will be going down at 9.
Well, what about him?
No, he says he wants to betrained on his own from now on.
What?
It's kind of thing does happenat this point if there's... ...only one winner.
We should have somechocolate covered stoke.
Ladies and gentlemen.Your master of ceremonies...
Caesar Flickerman!
Thank you!
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
To the 74th Annual Hunger Games.
Now, there are five minutes theyare all going to be out here.
All of the Tributesthat you heard about.
Are you excited?
Let me hear it!
Amazing.
I don't feel amazing.
Don't you know howbeautiful you look? No.
And I don't knowhow to make people
like me, how do youmake people like you?
Why do you made me like you?
That's different.I wasn't trying.
Exactly.
Just be yourself.I'll be there the whole time. ...and just pretendyou're talking to me.
Okay?
Okay.
Let's see if shedoes indeed shine.
Let's have a warm roundof applause for Glimmer.
Glimmer, are you prepared?
Yes Caesar, I am prepared.
I like it, that's just...
Big round of applause.
Marvel!
Welcome Clove.
It's an honor torepresent my district.
So you're a fighter?
I'm prepared, viciousand I'm ready to go.
Cato!
From District 12...
You know her... ...as the girl on fire!
Where we know it's Katniss Everdeen!
What?
I think someone's a little nervous.
I said that was quite andentrance that you've made at the Tribute'sParade the other day.
Do you want to tell us about it?
Well, I was just... ...hoping that Iwouldn't burned it up!
When you came out of that chariot...
I have to say...
My heart... stopped.
To earn you experiences as well.
My heart stopped.
So did mine.
Now tell me bout the flames... are they real?
Yes.
In fact I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?
Wait, wait, wait.
Is it safe?
What do you think folks?
I think that's a yes!
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.
Thank you for that.
I have one more question for you.
It's about your sister...
We are all very moved, I think when... ...you volunteered forher at the Reaping.
Does she come to say goodbye to you.
Yes.
She did.
And what did you say to her?
In the end?
I told her that I would try to win.
That I will try to win for her.
Of course you did.
And try you will.
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl On Fire!
You did it darling.
That was incredible.
Thank you.
Nice job sweetheart.
Thank you.
Nice dress too.
Are yours?
Peeta Mellark!
Peeta, welcome.
How are you finding the Capitol? Don't say with a map.
Uh, it's uh... different.
It's very different.
Different? In what are? Give us an example.
Uh okay, well theshowers here are weird.
Showers?
Yes.
We have different showers.
I have a question for you Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?
Um...
Do I?
Yeah.
Do I smell like it?
You definitely smellbetter than I do.
Well I live here longer.
So Peeta... ...tell me.
Is there a special girl back home?
No, not really.
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.Handsome man like you... Peeta.
Tell me.
Well, there a...
There's this one girl that...
I had a crush on forever.
But I don't think she actuallyrecognize me until the Reaping.
Well...
I'll tell you what Peeta.
You go out there... ...and you win this thing.
And when you get home.
She'll have to go out with you.
Right folks?
Thanks but I uh...
I don't think winningsgonna help me at all.
And why not?
Because she came here with me.
Well, that's bad luck.
Yeah. It is.
And I wish you all the best of luck.
Thank you.
Peeta Mellark.
District 12!
What the hell is that?!
You don't talk to me and yousay you have a crush on me?
You say you wanna train alone... is that how you wanna play?
Stop! Stop it!
Start right now.
He did you a favor.
He made me look weak.
He made you look desirable.
Which in your case, can't hurt sweetheart!
He's right Katniss.
Of course, I'm right.
Now I can sell the star crosslovers from District 12.
We are not star cross lovers.
It's a television show.
And being in love withthat boy might just get you Sponsors which couldsave your damn life.
Okay... why don't you get out of here?
Maybe acting to live save youboth to one piece tomorrow.
Manners.
You too?
Oh, hey.
Can't sleep?
No, of course not.
I'm sorry I went after you.
You know I meant thatas a compliment.
I know.
Listen...
Yeah?
I just don't wanna change me.
How did they change you?
I don't know.
I'm turning to something I'm not.
I just don't wanna be anotherpiece in their game, you know?
You mean you won't kill anyone?
No.
I'm not yet sure I would.
Just like any by offmy time came with.
Yeah, I just keep... wishing I could thinkof a way to show them.
That they don't own me.
You know, if I'm gonna die.
I wanna still be me.
Does that make any sense?
Yeah.
I just can't affordto think like that.
I miss my sister.
Yeah I know.
Guess, I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
They put all kind ofstuff right in front.
Right in the mouth of the Curnocopia.
There'll even be a bow there.
Don't go for it.
Why not?
It's a Bloodbath, they'retrying to pull you in.
It's not your game.
You turn, run, finda high ground.
Look for water.Water's your new best friend.
Don't step off that pedestal earlieror they'll blow you sky high.
I won't.
Katniss.
You can do this.
Thanks.
Give me your arm.
Give me your arm.
Give me your arm.
What is that?
Your tracker.
Less than a minute people!
Final checks.
So fifteen up, they are flying.
Here.
Thank you.
30 seconds.
I'm not allowed to bet.
But if i could I'd bet on you!
20 seconds.
10 seconds.
Okay, they're in the tubes.
50... ...49... ...48... ...47... 46... ...45... 44... ...43... 42... ...41... 40... ...39... 38... ...37... 36... ...35... 34... ...33... 32... ...31... 30... ...29... 28 ...27... 26... ...25... 24... ...23... 22...
And of course...
There's the familiarboom of the cannon.
Which marks the end ofanother fallen Tribute.
Well, that makes 13 gonein the first eight hours.
And Claudius, I think Iseen alliance forming.
Please don't kill me. Oh no!
Hey, loverboy!
You sure she went this way?
Yeah, I'm sure.
You better be.
Yeah. That was a steercomb back there.
Are you sure we shouldn'tjust kill him now?
Nah. He's our bestchance at finding her.
Sir.
She is almost at the edge.
Two kilometers away fromthe nearest Tribute.
Let's turn her around.
Killing another on my account... one.
Two.
Uh, she's headingtowards the left flank.
Okay.
Sure.
She's almost there.
Lucia, get a cannon ready.
Oh there she is. There she is.
What you got baby?
Kill here Cato!
I'm coming for you!
I'll do it myself.
Get her!
Come on.
Maybe you should throw the sword.
Let's just wait her out.
She's gonna come down at some points.That's gonne start her there.
Okay.
Somebody make a fire.
Thank you.
Claudius. I think those aretrackerjackers. Am I wrong?
Oooh.
Those things are very lethal.
Very.
For those of you who don't know.
Trackerjackers are geneticallyengineered wasps.
Whose venom causes serious pain.
Powerful hallucinations andin extreme cases, death.
Run!
Run!
Run!
Damn it.
Katniss, no! What're you doing?
Go!
Hallow isn't lethal.
But the venom of atrackerjacker sting... ...is enough to dozeoff hallucinations.
Please do something.
Katniss, go!
Get out of here! What're you doing?
Rue?
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.
You want mine too?
No, that's okay.
Here.
Thanks.
How long was I asleep?
A couple of days.
I change your leaves twice.
Thank you.
So what happened? When I was out?
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.
And the uh...
And the boy from my district?
No, he's okay.
I think he's down by the river.
Is all about true?
What?
You and him.
So where are Cato and the others?
They got all theirsupplies down by the lake.
It's prod up in thisgreat big pyramid.
That sounds tempting.
Now this green stuff isgonna smoke like crazy, so as soon as you light it.Move on to the next fire.
Light this one last.
And I'll meet you back over here.
Right.
I'll destroy their stuffwhile they're chasing us.
We need a signal, in caseone of us gets held up.
Okay. Like what?
Here. Watch this.
Mocking jays.
That's great.
Back home, we used themto signal all the time..
You try.
Okay so, if we hear that means we'reokay and we'll be back real soon.
We're gonna be okay.
Hey.
I'll see you for supper.
Okay.
Guys, guys look!
Come here. Come on, come on look!
Let's go.
You stay guard over till we get back.
I wanna see if she's gonnafigure out this booby trap.
Yes.
It seems theyreburied their mines around that big pile of goodies.
She certainly figureit out, haven't she?
Katniss!
Katniss!
Katniss help!

Help me! Help!

Lay down your head.
And close your eyes.

You just create a murder.
It seems I've already got one.
I heard this rumorsout on District 11.
This could get away from here.
What do you want?
There are a lot ofanger out there.
I know you know how to handlea mod, you've done it before.
If you can't scare them.Give them something to root for.
Such as?
Young love.
So you were like an underdog.
Everyone likes an underdog.
I don't.
How many are dead?
10? 11? 12?
Uh...
Not personally, no!
I have.
Lots of underdogs.
Not too cold too.
Row crops. Minerals.
Things we need.
There are lots of underdogs.
And I think if you could see them.
You would not root for them either.
Unlike you..
Be careful.

Until not so now.
How's that? Is that what you want?
Huh!

So what happens when we get back?
I don't know.
I guess I may try to forget.
I don't wanna forget.
LlFE OF PI Transcript and sync: Sheng – So, you were raised in a zoo? – Born and raised... ..
In Pondicherry, in what was the French part of India.
My father owned the zoo.
And I was delivered on short notice by a herpetologist, who was there to check on the Bengal monitor lizard.
Mother and I were both healthy, but the poor lizard escaped, and was trampled by a frightening category.
The way of Karma, huh?
The way of God.
That's quite a story.
I'd assumed your father was a mathematician, because of your name.
Not far from it, I was named after a swimming pool.
There was a pool named "Pl"?
You see, my uncle Francis was born with too much water in his lungs.
They say the doctor swung Francis around by the ankle, to clear the water out.
And that's what gives him his huge chest and skinny legs, that made him such a great swimmer.
Is Francis actually your uncle, he said he was friend with your father?
Well, he's my "Honorary" Uncle.
I call him "Mamaji". My father's best friend, my swimming guru.
I trained with him three times a week at the Ashton.
His lessons would save my life in the end.
A mouthful of water will not harden you.
But panic will. And remember to breath now, don't hold your breath.
Good boy.
I hope you don't mind vegetarian.
No, no.
Not at all. – And your name? – Uh?
You were going to tell me how you got your name, I think.
Oh yes! I got it from something Mamaji once told my father.
You see, most travelers collect postcards or tea cups and their jewelries, but not Mamaji.
Mamaji collects swimming pools.
He swims in every pool he comes upon.
One day, Mamaji said to my father, that of all the pools in the world, the most beautiful was a public pool in Paris.
That the water there was so clear, you could make your morning coffee with it.
That a single swim there changed his life.
Before I was born, he said:
"If you want your son to have a clean soul, you must take him one day to swim in the "piscine Molitor".
I never understood why my father took this so much too heart.
But he did.
And I was named "Piscine Molitor Patel". Imagine me trying to explain that name.
I barely made it to the age of eleven. before... before... – Hey, "pissing"!
Are you pissing right now?
Look at him, he is pissing.
With one word, my name went from an elegant French swimming pool to a stinking Indian latrine.
I was "pissing" everywhere.
No pissing in the schoolyard!
Even the teacher started doing it.
Not deliberately, of course. So then...
What made the kettle to release gas too quickly?
Pissing?
He said pissing, guys.
Pissing! That's enough!
When we returned the next for our first day of school, I was prepared.
Piscine Patel.
Good Morning. I am Piscine Molitor Patel.
Know to all as:
"Pl" The sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet.
Which is also used in mathematics to represent the ratio of any circle circcomference to its diameter.
An irrational number of infinite length, usually rounded to three digits, as 3 .1 4,
Pl.
Very impressive... Pl.
Now sit down. – Arvelu Sami? – Present.  And from then on, you were Pi?
Well no, not quite.
Nice try, Pissing.
But I still had the whole day ahead of me.
French class was next. Je m'appelle Piscine Molitor Patel.
Dit: Pi. Then geography.
These are the first twenty decimal places of Pi.
My last class of the day was mathematics.
4...
3... 7... 5... 8... 5... 8... 5... 8....
It's right! He's really doing this!
By the end of that day, I was "PI Patel", school legend.
Mamaji tells me you're a legend among sailors, do you?
Out there, all alone.
Oh, I don't even know how to sail.
And I wasn't alone out there, Richard Parker was with me.
Richard Parker?
Mamaji, he didn't tell me everything, he just said I should look you up when I got back to Montreal.
So what were you doing in Pondicherry?
Writing a novel.
By the way, I enjoyed your first book.
So this new one is set in India? No, Portugal actually.
But it's cheaper living in India.
Well, I look forward to reading it.
You can't. I threw it out.
Two years I was trying to bring these things to life, and they one day...
Spattered Caughin died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
So I was sitting in this coffee house in Pondicherry one afternoon mourning my boss, when this old man at the table next to me, struck up a conversation.
Yeah, Mamaji he does that.
When I told him my abandoned book, he said:
So, a Canadian. Let's come to French India, and seach for a story.
Well, my friend,
I know an Indian in French Canada, with the most incredible story to tell.
It must be fate that the two of you should meet.
Well I haven't spoken about Richard Parker in so many years.
So what has Mamaji already told you?
He said you had a story that would make me believe in God.
He would say that about a nice meal.
As for God, I can only tell you my story.
You'll decide for yourself what you believe.
Fair enough. Let's see then.
Where to begin?
Pondicherry... is the French Bureau of India.
In this place, closest to the ocean, you might think you are in the south of France.
A few blocks inland, there's a canal.
Just beyond that, is Indian Pondicherry.
And the Muslim quarter is just to the west.
When the French handed Pondicherry back to us in 1954, the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order.
My father was a clever businessman.
He came up with one.
He ran a hotel, and he got the idea to open a zoo in the local botanical gardens instead.
As it also happened, my mother was a botanist in the gardens.
They met, married, and a year later, my brother Ravi was born.
I came two years after that.
Sounds magical.
Growing up in... Amen.
Yeah, let's eat.
I did not know Hindus said Amen.
Catholics Hindus do Catholic Hindus?
We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods, instead of just one.
But you're a Hindu first.
None of us knows God until someone introduces us.
I was first introduced to God as a Hindu.
There are 33 million gods in the Hindu regilion.
How can I not come to know a few of them?
I met Krishna, first.
The gods were my superheroes, growing up.
Hanuman, the monkey god.
Lifting an entire mountain to save his friend, Laksh woman.
Ganesh, the elephant headed, risking his life to defend the honor of his mother, Parvati.
Vishnu, the supreme soul, the source of all things.
Vishnu sleeps, floating on the shoreless cosmic ocean, and we are the stuff of his dreaming.
Spectacle.
Don't let the stories and pretty lies fool you, boys.
Religion is darkness. My dear Apa believed himself part of the new India.
As a child, he'd had polio.
He used to lie in bed wracked with pain, wondering where God was.
In the end, God didn't save him, Western medecine did.
My Amma went to college and thought our familly was part of the new India as well,
But then her parents cut her off, because they thought she was marying Benito.
Our religion was the only link she had to her past.
I met Christ in the mountains when I was 12.
We were visiting relatives, Pigroes in Monar.
It was a third there, Ravi and I were terribly bored.
Challenge. I give you two ruppies.
Run into that church, and drink the holy water.
You must be thirsty.
Here.
I brought you this.
Why would a God do that?
Why would he send his own son to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?
Because he loves us.
God made himself approachable to us, human, so we could understand him.
We can't understand God nor his perfection.
But we can understand God son, and his suffering, as we would of brothers. That made no sense!
Sacrificing the innocent, to atone for the sins of the guilty, what kind of love is that?
But this son, I couldn't get him out of my head.
If God is so perfect, and we are not, why would he want to create all this?
Why does he need us at all?
All you have to know is that he loves us.
God so loved his world that he gave his only son.
The longer I listened to the priest, the more I came to like the son of God.
Thank you Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ.
I came to faith through Hinduism, and I found God's love through Christ.
But God wasn't finished with me yet. God works in mysterious ways.
And so it was he introduced him to me again, this time by the name of Allah.
My Arabic was never very good.
But the sound and feel of the words brought me closer to God.
In performing "Salah", the ground I touched became holly ground, and I found a feeling of serenity and brotherhood.
This lamb is exquisite.
It's the best dish on the table.
You're all missing out.
You only need to convert to three more religions, Piscine, and you'll spend your life on holiday.
Are you going to Mecca this year, Swami Jesus?
Or to Rome for your coronation as Popeius?
Yourself, don't be silly.
Just like you like cricket, Pi has his own interest.
No, Gita. Ravi has a point, you know?
You cannot follow three different religions at the same time, Piscine.
Why not?
Because, believing in everything at the same time, is the same as not believing in anything at all.
He's young, Santosh.
He's still finding his way. And how can he find his way, if he does not choose a path?
Listen, instead of leaping from one region to the next, why not start with reason?
In few hundred years, science has taken us farther in undertanding the universe, than the regilon has in ten thousand.
That is true. Your father is right.
Science can teach us more about what is out there, but not what is in here.
Some eat meat, some eat vegetable,
I do not expect us to all to agree about everything, but
I would much prefer they'll have you believe in something I don't agree with, than to accept everything blindly.
And that begins with thinking rationally.
You understand?
Good.
I would like to be baptised.
So, you're a Christian, and a Muslim.
And an Hindu, of course. And a Jew, I suppose.
Well I do teach the course on the Kabala at the University.
And why not? Faith is a house with many rooms.
But no room for doubt? Oh, plenty.
On every floor.
Doubt is useful. It keeps Faith a living thing.
After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it has been tested.
Where' Sothom? We shouldn't be in here without him.
Stop worrying.
I have seen him do this a thousand times.
I want to meet our new tigre.
Pi! Hello?
Richard Parker? tigre?
Richard Parker was a tigre? Yeah, he got this name through a clerical error.
A hunter caught him drinking from a stream when he was a cub, and named him "Thirsty".
When Thirsty got too big, the hunter sold him to our zoo, but the name got switched on the paperwork.
The hunter was listed as Thirsty, and the tigre was called Richard Parker.
We laughed about it. And the name stuck!
Let's go...
Before we get into trouble!
I want to see him closer. You're not the zoo people!
Come on!
That's it Richard Parker.
It's for you.
No!
What are you thinking?
Are you out of your mind?
Who gave you the permission to come back here?
You just ignored everything I've ever taught you?
I-I just wanted to say Hello to him.
You think that tigre is your friend.
He's an animal, not a playmate!
Animals have souls.
I have seen it in their eyes.
Find Selvan.
Animals do not think like we do.
People who forget that, get themselves killed.
That tigre... is not your friend.
When you look into his eyes, you are seeing your own emotions reflected back at you.
Nothing else.
You stupid. Say "I'm sorry."
What have you done, Piscine?
You know what your father said about coming back here?
I am sorry.
I was... What are you thinking?
This is between a father and his sons.
Selvan, cut away! He said he's sorry.
You'll just scare them for life.
Scare them? That boy almost lost his arm.
But he's just a boy.
He will be a man sooner than you think.
And this is a lesson I do not want them ever to forget!
Selvan!
.. and so has placed the country in a state of emergency
Under the directive, the states of cultural...
Things changed after the day of Apa's lesson.
The world had lost some of its enchantment.
School was a bore, nothing but facts, fractions and french.
Words and patterns that went on and on without end, just like my irrational nickname.
I grew restless, searching for something that might bring meaning back into my life.
And then, I met Anandi.
Mother made me study music.
And one day, my teacher came down with the flew.
He asked if I could take his place, playing rythms for the dance class.
No!
If you do not concentrate, you cannot express your love of God through dance.
Feel the ground beneath your feet.
Open your 'Gisauthon' to the horizon.
Let that spiritual energy pass through you, and out into the world.
Anandi, come to the front, lead them.
Why are you following me? What?
You were following me.
What does this mean?
In the dance, you went from 'batanka', which means the forest,
And then you did... and you did...
'Sanputa', which means something that is hidden.
Now for that you did this.
And then you did 'Chatura'.
But at the very end, you did... this.
None of the others dancers did that.
What did you mean, the God of love is hiding in the forest?
No, that also means 'the Lotus flower'.
Lotus flowers hiding in the forest?
Why would a Lotus flower hide in the forest?
This is Richard Parker.
He's the most magnificent creature we've ever had here.
Look at the way he's turning his head.
Showing off... like a dancer.
No. He heard something.
He is listening, you see?
We have talked about it for some time.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Pi!
Uh sorry, you've been...
Worried.
For my family.
For animals are worth far more abroad than here in India.
And if the town council stops supporting us, I don't know where we will be.
So what is worth, we have to do.
Do you understand?
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?
We are leaving India.
What?
We are selling the zoo.
The zoo was never ours to sell, the land belongs to the town.
But the animals are ours. and if we sell them, we will have enough to start a new life.
But where will we go?
Or life is here, Apa! Canada.
I have some opportunities for work in Winnipeg.
I'll be shipping most of the animals for sale in North America, we can get freighter passage for the whole family.
So...
It's settled.
We will sail like Columbus.
But Columbus was looking for India!
It takes a lot of work to set a zoo.
Before we left, Anandi and I had time enough to break each other's heart.
Of course, I promised I would come back one day.
It's funny...
I remember everything else about our last day.
But I don't remember saying goodbye.
Pi?
They're serving diner below. Piscine.
You have a whole life ahead of you.
We are doing this for you and Ravi.
Come inside and have some diner.
Vegetarian, please.
Oh, my sons and I are vegetarians.
Do you have anything- No no no no no! Not for gravy.
You don't want gravy?
Pas de problème. Pardon.
Pas de problème.
Hello. I am happy Buddist.
So I eat rice next to gravy.
I'm sure, gravy is not meat.
Is taste.
You try?
Don't worry.
We will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in Manila.
Why give Orange Juice tranquilizers?
He's not gonna cause any trouble.
The stress of traveling is not good for the animals, and it helps with the sea sickness.
We don't want to be cleaning up, after a sea sick orang utan.
My father was a businessman.
He had never attended the animals himself. I realized leaving India must have been harder for him than it was for me.
So?
Yeah, have I forgotten anything?
I think you set the stage,
So far, we have an Indian boy named after a French swimming pool, and a Japanese ship full of animals, heading to Canada.
Yes!
Now we have to send our boy into the middle of the Pacific, and...
And make me believe in God.
Yeah.
We'll get there.
It was four days out of Manila, above the Mariana trench, the deepest part on earth.
Our ship, the Simsum, pushed on, polishly in different surroundings.
It moved with the slow massive confidence of a continent. Did you hear that, Ravi?
Yes, what do you think?
It's a thunderstorm, let's go and watch.
Are you crazy?
We will get hit by lightning.
No, we won't, it'll hit the bridge first.
Don't tempt the storm, Pi.
Oyé!
Hurray! God's storm!
Ma!
Apa!
Ravi! Get out!
Get out! Please save my family!
Don't scare, okay? Stay here!
You have to help my family!
We have to help them!
My family is back there!
Leave now!
We have to go!
Who let all the animals out, uh? – We have to go now! – No please, my father!
He's got to go!
There!
Look there! Zebra! Zebra!
Hey!
Over here! Over here! Richard Parker?
No! No! No!
Go away! Go away! Ama!
Apa!
Ravi! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
Orange Juice!
Orange Juice!
Where is your buoy, Orange Juice?
Don't worry.
I bet mother and father found it. They'll all be here soon.
Hello!
Hello!
Anybody!
No! Stop it!
No!
Stop it! Stop it! No!
Sorry Orange Juice, I don't have any sea sickness medicine for you.
Is it right?
Is it right?
Yes! Yes!
No! No!
No! No! Com'on!
Com'on! Com'on!  My name is Pi Patel.
I have been on a ship wreck.
I am on a lifeboat, alone... with a tigre.
Please send help.
God...
I give myself to You. I am your vassal.
Whatever comes, I want to know.
Show me.
There are no lines.
Set ​​your house in order, and dig in for the battle to survive.
Establish a strict schedule for eating, keeping watch, and getting rest. Do not drink urine or seawater.
Keep busy, but avoid unnecessary exertion.
The mind can be kept get occupied by playing card games,
"Twenty Questions" or "Eye Spy". Community singing is another sure fire way to lift the spirit.
Telling stories is highly recommended.
Above all, don't lose hope.
Few things can sap the spirit faster than sea sickness.
Waves are more strongly felt when the boat turns sideway to the current.
A sea anchor is used as a drag to keep the boats head to the wind.
Proper use of them can increase control, and reduce sea sickness during rough seas.
For castaways who must share their lifeboats with large dangerous carnivals, it's advisable to establish your territory as your own.
Try this method.
Step 1:
Choose a day when waves are moderate, but regular.
Step 2:
With the lifeboat facing into the waves, making the ride as comfortable as possible, blow your whistle soothingly.
Turn the lifeboat sideways to the waves, accompanied by harsh, aggressive use of the whistle.
With sufficient repetition, the animal will associate the sound of the whistle with the discomfort of sea sickness.
Similar methods have long been used by circus trainers, tough they generally lack access to rough seas.
Let the trumpets blow!
Let the drummers begin!
Prepare to be amazed!
Organized for your enjoyment, and instruction.
The show you've been waiting for all you rlife, will soon begin!
Are you ready for the miracle event?
Well done!
I give to you, the astounding Bengal tigre!
Hello, Richard Parker.
Sorry for the choppy ride. Mine! You understand?
Yours! Mine! You understand?
Step 4:
Disregard steps 1 through 3. Here, Richard Parker.
I got some water for you. In the zoo, we fed the tigres in average of five kilos of meat a day.
Richard Paker will getting hungry soon.
Tigres are powerful swimmers, and if he gets hungry enough,
I'm afraid the little bit of water between us won't be any protection. I need to find a way to feed him.
I can eat the biscuits, but God made tigres carnivores,
So I must learn to catch fish. If I don't,
I'm afraid his last meal will be a skinny vegetarian boy. Patience!
Wait! Thinking.
Two cartons of biscuits...
93 cans of water...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Lord Vishnu!
Thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our life!
Thank you!
Of course, I brought all the biscuits and water on the raft with me, to keep them safe...
Hunger can change everything you ever thought you knew about yourself.
Here, it's yours!
It's time to settle this.
If we're going to live together, we have to learn to communicate.
Maybe but the Jutbaka can't be teamed.
But with God's will, it can be trained. No!
Good.
Go, Richard Parker.
Go! Go on home, I'll leave you alone.
I'll respect that, promise.
Go! Come on!
Yes!
I never thought a small piece of shit could bring me so much happiness.
That a pile of tools, a bucket, a knife, a pencil, might become my greatest treasures, without knowing Richard Parker was here might ever bring me peace.
In times like these,
I remember that he has as little experience of the real world as I do.
We were both raised in a zoo by the same master. Now we've been orphaned,
left to face our ultimate master together. Without Richard Parker, I would have died by now.
My fear of him keeps me alert.
Tending to his needs gives my life focus.
Dolphins.
Hey, Richard Parker!
Hey!
Mortal, all I have left and hang on to.
Everything make stopped, fragmented.
Can't tell day dreams, night dreams from reality anymore.
A storm, Richard Parker!
Christ needs you, God!
Longing for his words!
The compassionate!
The mercyful! Come out!
Richard Parker!
Come out, you have to see this! It's beautiful!
Relieve yourself!
He's come to us! It's a vision!
Come on, this is God, Richard Parker!
Why are you scaring him?
I've lost my family,
I've lost everything! I surrender!
What else do you want? I'm sorry, Richard Parker.
We're dying, Richard Parker.
I'm sorry.
Amma...
Apa, Ravi. Apa, Ravi, I'm going to see you soon.
Can you feel the rain?
God...
Thank you for giving me my life. I'm ready now.
Richard Parker.
Hey. Get rid of me!
It's my bed. It was a human tooth.
Don't you see the island was carnivorous?
Canívorous?
Like a Venus fly trap? Yes. The whole island.
The plants, the water and those pools, the very ground itself.
During the day, those pools held fresh water.
But at night, some chemical process turned the water in those pools into acid.
The sound of meerkats scaring to the trees, and Richard Parker running to the boat.
Years ago, some poor fellow just like me must have found himself stranded on that island.
And like me, he thought he might there forever.
But all that the island gave him by day, it took away again by night.
To think how many hours he spent, with only meerkats for company.
How much loneliness taken on him.
All I know is that eventually he died, and the island digested him,
leaving behind only his teeth.
I saw how my life would end, if I stayed on that island.
Alone, forgotten.
I had to get back to the world, or die trying.
I spent the next day preparing the boat.
I filled my stores with fresh water, ate sea weed until my stomach could take no more, and brought as many meerkats as I could fit into the storey's locker for Richard Parker.
I couldn't leave without him, of course.
It would be killing him.
And so I waited for his return.
I knew he wouldn't be late.
Richard Parker!
No one has seen that floating island since.
And you won't read about those trees in any nature book.
And yet, if I hadn't found those shores, I would have died.
And if I hadn't discovered that tooth, I would have been lost, alone forever.
Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, he was watching.
Even when he seemed indifferent to my suffering, he was watching.
And when I was beyond all hope of saving, he gave me rest.
And gave me a sign to continue my journey.
By the time we reached the Mexican shore,
I was afraid to let go off the boat. My strength was gone, I was so weak.
I was afraid that in two feet of water, so close to deliverance, I would drown.
I struggled to shore, and fell upon the sand.
It was warm and soft, like pressing my face against the cheek of God.
And somewhere, two eyes were smiling, that having me there.
I was so spent, I could hardly move.
And so Richard Parker went ahead of me.
He stretched his legs, and walked along the shore.
At the edge of the jungle, he stopped.
I was certain he was going to look back to me.
Flatten his ears to his head, proud, that he would bring our relationship to an end in some way.
But he just teared ahead into the jungle.
And then, Richard Parker, my fierce companion, the terrible one who kept me alive...
disappeared forever from my life.
After a few hours, a member of my own species found me.
He left and returned with a group who carried me away.
And I wept like a child, not because I was overwhelmed of having survived, although I was.
I was whiping because Richard Parker left me... so unceremoniously.
It broke my heart.
You know, my father was right.
Richard Parker never saw me as his friend.
After all we had been through, he didn't even look back.
But I have to believe there was more in these eyes than my own reflection staring back at me.
I know it, I felt it.
Even if I can't prove it.
You know, I've left so much behind, my family, the zoo, India, Anandi...
I suppose India and the whole of life becomes an act of letting go.
But what will always hurt the most, is not taking a moment to say goodbye.
I was never able to thank my father, for all I know from him.
To tell him without his lessons...
I would never have survived!
I know Richard Parker's a tigre, but...
I wish I had said: "It's over, we survived... thank you for saving my life.
I love you, Richard Parker.
You'll always be with me".
But I can't be with you.
I don't know what to say.
It's hard to believe, isn't it?
It is a lot to take in... to figure out what that all means.
No, if it happened, it happened.
Why should it have to mean anything? But some of it is pretty incredible.
See, I was the only one who survived the ship wreck.
The Japanese shipping company sent two men to talk to me, in the Mexican hospital where I was recovering.
I still have a copy of the report.
There are insurance claims to settle.
They wanted to find out why the ship sank.
They didn't believe me, either.
Thousands of meerkats, on an floating carnivorous island, and no one has ever seen it.
Yes. Just like I told you.
Bananas don't float.
You said the orang utan floated to you on a bundle of bananas, but bananas don't float.
Of course they do, you try it for yourself!
In any case, we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats.
Look, I just told a long story, and I'm very tired.
We are here because a Japanese cargo ship sank in the Pacific!
Something I'll never forget.
I lost my whole family.
We don't mean to push you.
And you have our deepest sympathies.
But we have come a long way, and we are not closer to understanding why the ship sank.
Because I don't know!
I was asleep, something woke me up, it could have been an explosion, I can't be sure.
And then the ship sank.
What else do you want from me? A story that won't make us look like fools.
We need a simpler story for our report.
One our company can understand.
A story we can all believe.
So a story without things you've never seen before.
That's right.
Without surprises, without... animals or islands.
Yes. The truth.
So... what did you do?
I told them another story.
Four of us survived, the cook and the sailor were already aboard.
The cook threw me a life buoy and pull me aboard, and Mother held on on some bananas and made it to the life boat.
The cook... was a disgusting man.
He ate a rat!
We had food enough for weeks, but he found the rat in the first few days and he killed it, he dried it in the sun and ate it.
Just a brute bad man.
But he was ressourcefull.
It was his idea to build the raft to catch fish, we would have died in those first few days without him.
The sailor was the same man who brought rice and gravy, the buddhist.
He didn't understand much what he said, only that he was suffering.
He'd broken his leg horribly in the fall.
We tried to set it best we could, but the leg became infected.
And the cook said that we had to do something, but he... died.
The cook said he'd do it, but mother and I had to hold the man down.
And I believed him, we needed to do it.
So...
I kept saying "I'm sorry, I'm sorry".
He just kept looking at me, his eyes were so...
I'll never understand the point of that man suffering.
I can still hear him:
"I happy with this, you need rice and gravy."
We didn't save him, of course. He died.
The morning after the cook caught his first Dorado and I didn't understand what he'd done at first, but Mother did, and I had never seen Mother so angry.
"Stop whining and be happy", he said.
"We need more food or we'll die, thas was the whole point!"
What was the whole point, Madrast?
You let that poor boy dying only to get bait, you monster!
He's got furious, he started towards her with his fists raised,
And Mother slapped him hard right across the face!
I was stunned!
I thought he was gonna kill her right then.
It would end...
The cook didn't stop with bait either, no...
The sailor... he went the same way as the rat went.
The cook was a resourceful man.
It was a week later that he... because of me.
Because I couldn't hold on this stupid turtle.
It slipped out of my hand and swam away, and the cook came up, and he punched me on the side of my head, and my teeth clacked and I saw stars,
I thought he was gonna hit me again, but Mother started pounding on him, with her face screaming "monster, monster!"
She held with me go to the raft.
'Nipola!" I thought she was coming with me, or I'd never have!
I don't know why I didn't make her go first.
I think about that every day.
I jumped over and turned back just as the knife came out.
There wasn't anything I could do.
Couldn't look away...
He threw her body overboard, and then the sharks came.
And I saw her, they... saw...
Next day, I killed him.
He didn't even fight back, he knew he'd gone too far.
Even by his own standards.
He left the knife out of the bench, and I did to him what he did to the sailor.
He was such an evil man, but was still hum...
He brought the evil out of me!
And I have to live with that.
I was alone in the lifeboat... drifting across the Pacific ocean... and I survived.
After that, there had no more questions.
The investigators didn't seem to like the story, exactly.
They thanked me. They wished me well... and they left.
So the story is...
Both the zebra and the sailor... broke their leg.
And a hyena killed the zebra and the orang utan.
So...
The hyena is the cook... the sailor is the zebra... your mother is the orang utan.
and... you're... the tigre.
Can I ask you something?
Of course.
I told you two stories about what happened out in the ocean...
Neither explains what cause the sinking of the ship.
And no one can prove which story is true and which is not.
In both stories, the ship sinks, my family dies, and I suffer.
True.
So which story do you prefer?
The one with the tigre.
That's the better story.
Thank you.
And so it goes with God.
Mamaji was right.
It's an amazing story.
Will you really let me write it? Of course.
Isn't that why Mamaji sent you here, after all?
My wife is here. Do you want to stay for diner?
She's an incredible cook!
I didn't know you had a wife. And a cat and and two children.
So your story does have an happy ending.
Well... that's up on you.
The story is yours now.
"Mr. Patel's is an astounding story.
Of courage and endurance, unparalleled in the history of shippings.
Very few can claim to have survived so long at sea.
And none in the company... of an adult Bengal tigre.
– Hi, Dad. – Get home. We have a guest, let me introduce you.
Hi. Very nice to meet you.
Adika.
Ravi.
Transcript and sync: Sheng
Mayday, mayday.
This is Hesper 2-9-9, heavy in distress. Dad!
Engines 1 and 2 are offline.
We're losing her. Go!
Go!
I've heard stories of Earth.
A paradise... ...until we destroyed it.
The founding of the Uniting Ranger Corps, One thousand years ago... ...was a global military effort... ...in evacuation of earth.
The rangers would lead the settlement of mankind in its new home.
Nova Prime. But we were not alone.
The aliens released the Ursas.
Monsters. Bred to kill humans. Technically blind.
The Ursas see humans based on the pheromones... ...secrete when frightened
They literally smell our fear.
Humankind was again in danger of extinction, and again turned to the rangers for the answer.
And that answer came in the form... ...of the prime commander Cypher Raige.
The original Ghost.
He's believed to be soul completely free of fear, that to an Ursa... ...he's invisible.
This phenomena is known as 'Ghosting'.
--- ---  This isn't a race, cadet.
Raige.
Your test scores are very impressive.
In the classroom you are an outstanding ranger, but in the field you collapse.
I'm not advancing you.
You may try again next year.
Sir, I am dedicated, I've studied... ...and consistently displayed conduct becoming a ranger, sir.
I request that the commander reconsider his assessment, sir. - Cadet...
- Sir, my father is returning home tonight.
I haven't seen him in...
It's a very special day for our family. and I've gotta be able to tell him that I'm a ranger, sir.
You tell your father... ...that I said welcome home.
Dismissed. Faia.
Hi.
How were finals?
- How were finals?
- I wasn't advanced to ranger. Where do we look when we speak?
I was not advanced to ranger.
You were not advanced to ranger?
I was not advanced to ranger, Sir. That's all right, you're young...
I ran the canyons 11 seconds faster than you did.
You weren't ready.
Velan is a good man, he knows his stuff.
If you were, he would've promoted you. You weren't ready. I'm not hungry.
I'm going to my room. Are you asking me or telling me?
- May I go to my room, sir?
- Denied. Sit down. Our last visit to Iphitos... ...flying tomorrow.
Supervising training... ...and after it's completed,
I'm announcing my retirement. Retirement?
Maybe I'll work with you... ...in Turbine division.
Together.
I want my family back.
I want you back.
That boy in there... ...is trying to find you.
He's a feeling boy.
He's an intuitive boy.
He watched you read that book with Senshi his entire life.
He's reading that book now.
He's reaching for you. Don't get me wrong,
I respect everything you've done.
But you have a son in the other room that... ...who do not know.
He blames himself on what happened to Senshi.
He thinks it's his fault.
He's drowning.
And he does not need a commanding officer.
He needs a father. Pack your bags.
You're coming with me to Iphitos. This was a really good decision.
Now go and make some good memories together.
You take it easy on your father. He's a little rusty.
Okay. General Raige.
I was on the Plathom, to save me and four others.
I just came from seeing my baby girl's face for the first time. Stand me up.
That won't be necessary ranger.
Damn, stand me up.
I'm reading 'Moby-Dick'.
Your mother told me.
That's great.
Our military transporter will arrive training base on Iphitos in seven hours.
I'm gonna grab some rack time. I recommend you do the same. Hey.
Can you read? I said, can you read?
Yes, sir.
Well, there's a sign back there:
'Authorized Personnel Only.'
Why didn't you read that? What's in the cage?
Might wanna go easy on him, Serge.
That's the Prime Commander son right there.
- You're Raige's kid? - What's in there? You wanna see?
Kit, we have to go.
Right now. - Is that...
- They surprised us.
Senshi, abstract those things.
- Taking it to Iphitos.
For ghost training.
You wanna see if you can ghost? Ghosting is when you don't have a trace of fear in you.
Most guys freeze.
That's your cerebral cortex looking for an answer it doesn't have.
See, even your brain knows you're screwed.
Your blood is filling with adrenaline right now... ...whether you know it or not.
Your heart's beating fast.
It's getting a little harder to breath.
Your neurobiological system is telling you to run, but your knees are too weak to move.
And it's... too late anyway.
The pores in your skin have already opened up.
It's secrete an imperceptible amount of pheromones into the air.
And all you can think about is when it gonna kill you. Senshi.
She sees you, kid.
Attention on deck.
Kitai, back to your seat now. Rangers, go red-con one.
Secure all cargo.
Behind your seat there's a life-suit.
Put it on now. Strap in, full harness. -Yes, sir.
- Good evening, General. - Captain.
What's the last known position of the closest asteroid storm? Category-4 asteroid formation.
2,000km to starboard and plus 4-5 declination.
I detected graviton-vibrations in the hull. Which you detected, how?
Graviton build-up could be a precursor to mass-expansion.
That storm could be on us in minutes.
But, sir, mass-expansion is one in a million. What's the last known position of the closest asteroid storm? ...the pull of our own graviton wake could set the thing off.
Let's just hold course and hope I'm wrong.
Just out of interest, sir,
How often are you wrong?
My wife would give a very interesting answer to that question.
Graviton count's decreasing.
800 parts per million.
650.
Well, sir, there's a first time for everything.
Turn into it.
Match bearing. Dad.
She's a dead stick.
Engines 1 and 2 are offline. we losing her.
- Can you travel us out of here? - Where? The anchorage on Lycia.
It's the closest. Negative, sir.
We cannot worm-hole travel in the middle of this.
Do it. Coordinates for anchorage at Lycia locked in.
No confirmation signal, sir.
Travel us now.
- Sir, without confirmation... - That's an order. Go.
Go.
Cabin pressure dropping.
Heavy damage to outer hall.
There's a breach possible to middle cabin.
Find me something I can land on. Now. I got something.
Bearing 340 by 95.
Range, 86,000. Warning: this planet has been declared unfit for human habitation.
Placed under class-1 quarantine by the interplanetary authority.
Under penalty of law, Do not attempt to land.
Repeat: do not attempt to land.
It's not possible.
The computer might have defaulted back to a known demarcation point. No.
Not yet. - Travel us again.
- Negative, sir.
This ship is gonna tear apart at any moment. Set her down.
Mayday, mayday.
This is Hesper 2-9-9 heavy in distress.
We took heavy damage from an asteroid storm... ...and are going down with bingo power.
You all right?
Evaluate.
Good to go.
You confirm the Ursa's contained.
The back of the ship is gone.
Rangers, count off.
Rangers, count off. Damn.
The cockpit is directly above us.
Go. Left rear.
There's a utility compartment.
Inside, there's an emergency beacon. Silver.
Like a saucer. Bring it to me. Consolidate inventory up.
General Cypher Raige.
Crash landed.
Two confirmed survivors. Kitai, the emergency beacon you brought me will fire a distress signal deep into space.
But it's damaged.
There's another one in the tail section of our ship. This is us here.
That, is the tail.
Somewhere in this area.
It's approximately 100km from here. We need that beacon.
- You understand?
- Yeah.
Both my legs are broken. One very badly.
You are going to retrieve that beacon, or we are going to die.
- Do you understand? - Yeah.
Repeat what I just said.
I have to go retrieve the beacon, or we going to die.
You have air-filtration inhalers.
You need to take one now.
The fluid will coat your lungs, increase your oxygen extraction... ...allowing you to breath more comfortably in the environment.
You have six vials.
In your weight, that should be 20-24 hours each.
That's more than enough.
Your life-suit and backpack... ...are equipped with digital and virtual imaging.
So I'll be able to see everything that you see... ...and what you do not see.
I will guide you.
It'll be like I'm right there with you.
Take my cutlass. It's the C-40.
Full, 22 configurations.
Kitai, every single decision you make will be life or death.
This is a class-1 quarantined planet.
Everything in this planet has evolved to kill humans.
Do you know where we are?
No, sir. This is Earth.
And... the Ursa?
There are three possibilities.
First and most likeliest, it died in the crash.
The second and less likely, is that it is injured very badly and still contained.
The third and least likely, is that it is out.
We will proceed, however, in anticipation of the worst case scenario.
Every movement will be under protocol 'escape and evade'.
If he's out there,
I will see him long before he gets anywhere near you.
Do you understand? Yes, sir.
Do exactly as I tell you, and we will survive.
Kitai, calm down.
Take a knee. Root yourself in this present moment, now.
Sight, sound.
Smell.
What do you feel? My body feels heavier.
Very good.
Earth gravitational pull is different than at home.
Very good.
Now, let抯 go. What happened?
- You didn't see that?
- Kitai, what happened? I'm fine.
No change, I just slipped.
There's condensation on the stones.
I'm good to go. General Cypher Raige.
Initiating remote probe recon.
Primary target:
Ursa.
I want to reiterate that your navi-band... ...is our sole means of communication.
Roger.
Temperatures in this planet fluctuate dangerously, Kitai.
And most of the planet freezes over completely at night. But there are hot spots.
Geothermal nodes between here and the tail... ...that will keep you warm during the freeze-over.
You must reach one of these hot spots... ...each evening before nightfall.
- Is that understood?
- Copy. Standard operating procedure till I give you further instructions.
Stand by.
--- ---  Dad, are you there?
Hey, dad, are you there?
Dad? Are you there?
Hello?
I'm here.
A boy I know had this.
It's a real book.
For a museum.
It's 'Moby-Dick'. He said I can even hold on to it.
Hold on, to what?
The book, dad.
Do they really kill these whales?
We, Senshi, for their oils... ...and they almost disappeared.
Just before the age of carbon fuels.
Where's your brother?
Kit.
Hi.
Dad, are you there?
I'm here.
Where are you?
My suit turned to black.
I like it, but I think it's something bad. Your suit is made of smart-fabric.
It has motion sensors.
I'm tracking a life-form moving towards you from the west.
It's closing rapidly.
50m. 40.
30.
20.
10.
It is right there, Kitai.
Do not... move.
Recognize your power.
This will be your creation. Stand down, cadet.
- Kitai.
- Go away.
Control yourself, cadet. Kitai.
Stand down. Get away.
- Get the hell away.
- Kitai. To your rear.
Out to your rear.
Okay, I'm going.
There's a river, 250m straight ahead, go. They are no longer in pursuit.
Cadet, you are not being followed.
I repeat, you are not being followed.
Kitai, you are running from nothing. Kitai.
Kitai, put my damn cutlass away.
You are not being followed. Take a knee.
Take a knee, cadet. You want to die today, that's fine, but you are not going to kill me.
Kitai, I need you to do a physical assessment.
You are showing rapid blood contamination. Are you cut? I'm dizzy.
Kitai, self-eval.
Good, god.
Dad, I can't stand.
Open your med-kit.
You are going to have to administer the antitoxin in sequence.
Inject yourself the clear liquid first. Do it now.
I can't see.
The poison is affecting your nervous system.
Dad, please come help me. I can't see. I can't do this without my sight, dad.
Please, come and get me.
Kitai, inject yourself directly into your heart... ...with the first stage.
Do it now. Now the second.
ASAP. To your left, Kitai.
Left.
I can't feel my hand.
Dad, I can't feel my hands.
Press it into the ground.
Roll over on it and press it into the ground, Kitai. Great work, cadet.
But you are going to lie there for a moment.
The parasite that stung you... ...has a paralyzing agent in its venom.
So you are going to have to lie there for a little bit.
While the antitoxin does its job. It's time to wake up.
Son, the temperature is dropping five degrees every ten minutes.
You have got to wake up. Can you blink your eyes?
Son,
I need you to, please, blink your eyes.
Hey, dad.
Hey.
That suck.
That is correct. You got 9.7km to the hot spot.
How about you show me that 10k in 50 minutes, cadet?
Sir, yes, sir. Two mikes out.
All good. Who wants to be a ranger?
Who wants it? Watch him go.
Watch him go.
Five mikes out. Come on.
Lights out.
Happy 19th birthday, Senshi. Dad, you help me.
No, Senshi.
You go ahead. You blow. Come on, dad.
Blow. Nah.
You know there's no way I can actually do that from here. No.
I think you can. Faia, you're right there.
Help the girl.
You can do it. I love you, dad.
Hot spot one arrival:
H. plus 54 minutes.
Equipment check and consolidate.
Take your next inhaler. Your... oxygen extraction is bottoming.
Take your next breathing fluid.
Second dose of breathing fluid complete.
Count off remaining. Four vials remain, sir.
Repeat.
Four vials remain, sir.
Dad.
Dad.
I'm here.
How'd you do it?
How'd you first ghost?
Out for a run. Alone.
Something that I wasn't supposed to do.
Ursa de-camos,
Right in front of me.
I go for my cutlass...
It Shoots its pincer.
Right to my shoulder.
Next thing I know, we're over the cliff.
Falling. 30m.
Straight down.
Into the river. We settle onto the bottom.
It's on top of me.
But it's stopped moving.
And I realize... He's trying to drown me.
I'm thinking, 'I'm gonna die.
'I'm gonna die.'
You cannot believe this is how you gonna die.
I could see my blood bubbling up,
Mixing with the sunlight,
Shining through the water.
And I'm thinking, 'wow...
'That's really pretty.' Everything slows down.
I see his pincer through my shoulder.
And I decide:
I don't want that in there anymore.
So I pull it out. And it lets me go.
And more than that I can tell...
It can't find me.
It doesn't even know where to look. And it dawned on me...
Fear is not real.
The only place that fear can exist... ...is in our thoughts of a future.
It is a product of our imagination.
Causing us to fear things that do not at present... ...and may not ever exist.
That is near insanity, Kitai. Now, do not misunderstand me:
Danger, is very real.
But fear is a choice. We are all telling ourselves a story.
And that day, mine changed.
14km to the falls.
That's our midway checkpoint.
I'm reading you. ---
--- ---  Kitai, get to the falls.
ASAP. I hear something.
I think it's water.
A lot of it. Inventory up.
Roger.
Food rations, half available.
Flares, full.
Med-kit, half-available.
Breathing fluid...
Breathing fluid, four vials available. Why you're not showing me the case?
What?
Show it to me now.
I thought that I could make it, sir.
--- ---  ---
Abort mission. Return to the ship.
That is an order.
Don't come out.
No matter what.
That's an order. Help.
Help.
No, dad.
We...
I can do it. I can... I don't need many.
I can get across with just two.
You need a minimum of three inhalers to make it to the tail.
You have exhausted your resources. I can get across.
I can... I can do it with just two, dad.
This mission has reached abort criteria.
I'll take full responsibility. You did your best.
You have nothing more to prove.
Now, return to the ship.
What was your mistake?
Trusting me?. Depending on me?
Thinking that I can do this?
Now I'm giving you an order... ...to turn around... ...and return to this ship.
You wouldn't give any other ranger that order.
You are not a ranger, and I'm giving you that order.
What was I supposed to do?
What did you want me to do? She gave me an order.
She said, 'no matter what, don't come out of that box.'
Was I supposed to just come out and die?
What do you think, cadet? What do you think you should have done?
Because, really, that is all that matters.
What do you think you should have done?
And where were you?. She called out for you.
She called your name.
And you weren't there, cause you never there.
And you think I'm a coward?. You're wrong.
I'm not a coward. You're the coward.
I'm not a coward.
Kitai.
Kitai, you've got incoming.
Do you copy? You've got incoming. Don't...
Kitai, dive.
Dive.
Kitai.
No.
Leave them alone.
Get away.
Dad, I'm sorry, it's just...
Where is my son?
General Cypher Raige.
This is a message for my wife. Faia,
I have lost contact with our son.
End message.
You have six vials.
In your weight, that should be 20-24 hours each.
That's more than enough. I estimate four days to reach the tail.
We'll break it to sections.
You have six hours to reach the first geothermal site.
First leg is 20 km. to the mouth of the north forest. - I'm right here. - Five mikes out.
- Keep moving.
- That's about one hour.
Take your next inhaler.
H. plus 54 minutes.
There's an escarpment.
Looks like it could be a waterfall
We will call that our midway point.
I can get across.
I can do it with just two, dad. 14km to the forest.
This is us here.
That, is the tail.
You are going to retrieve that beacon... ...or we are going to die.
Leave me alone.
Wake up.
It's time for you to wake up.
Hey.
Hey.
I was just about to come out that day.
No, you weren't. But you did the right thing.
Dad says I should have tried.
He's just mad at himself, that's all. Why couldn't you ghost?
You're close right now.
I am?
Are you scared?
No.
I'm tired. That's good.
You filled your heart with something else.
Now you gotta get up. I memorized some 'Moby-Dick'.
Kitai, get up.
'All that most maddens and torments...' -Kitai, wake up.
- All that stirs up the lees of things.'
- Wake up. - It's time to wake up.
- 'All truth with malice in it.'
Kitai. -'All that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain.'
Wake up.
Hey... thanks.
--- No.
Dad.
Dad, it's Kitai.
I made it to...
Kitai?
-Dad, I made it to the tail, do you copy? Kitai, I'm here.
- Are you okay?
- Dad, do you read me? I copy.
Dad, I made it to the tail, do you copy?
Kitai, we have electrical interference. You're in a black zone.
I repeat, you are in a black...
Dad, the Ursa is not contained. Please, copy. - Dad?
- I'm here. I swear to you, I'm here.
Take a knee.
It is the ionic layer.
And the atmosphere above your current position, it is causing electrical interference.
That is why the beacon is not firing.
To your north.
The peak.
You must find the beacon... ...from the peak of that mountain.
See it, Kitai.
Please.
See it.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Good boy.
It is a pheromone trigger.
He set it to scare you... ...so he can track you.
Keep moving. It has found you.
Run.
Just run, Kitai.
Just run.
--- ---  Climb in there, okay?
It won't be able to smell you. Dad.
Root yourself in this present moment, now.
Sight, sound. Smell. What do you feel?
You're still in that box.
It's time to come out.
Stand me up.
General.
I said...
Stand me up. Watch his back.
Dad?
Yeah.
I wanna work with mom.
Yep. Me too.

Motherfuckers! Fuck.  (GRUNTlNG)
We're almost home, buddy! (CAR HORN HONKlNG)  Whoa!
My name's Alan and I bought a giraffe!
It's all mine!
It's super friendly! (HOWLlNG)  (BLEATlNG)
Oh, wow!. Look at the giraffe.  Oh, my God!.
Oh, my life is great! I have a wonderful life!
I have a wonderful life!
(GRUNTS) (FAMlLY SCREAMlNG)  (TRUCK HORN HONKlNG AND TlRES SCREECHlNG)
Yes, sir. Absolutely, I will. Thank you so much.
No, of course. No, no. And again, I'm so sorry.
That was the mayor, Alan. It was an accident.
You said you'd always love me no matter what I did.
I know and I do. You're my best friend.
But, Alan, why would you buy a giraffe?
I've always wanted one.
I could feed it from my tree house.
Besides, they remind me a lot of myself.
In what way?
They're majestic, pensive and tall.
- Pensive?
- Yeah!. - Where'd you learn that word?
- "Words With Friends."
- What friends, Alan? - You can set it on random. (GROANS)
Alan, aside from the fact that you shut down a freeway... you murdered a wild animal.
You don't wanna know the checks I had to write to fix this. Oh, please!.
We're rich!. We are not anything, Alan.
I am well-off. You! are my 40-year-old son...
Forty-two. I'm 42! 42-year-old son who still lives at home.
You are to go back on your medication or I'm cutting you off. You're bluffing.
When's dinner?
Your mother and I can't take this anymore!
- Well, you might have to. - I can't do it!
I cannot do this!
(INAUDlBLE DlALOGUE) BlLLY JOEL : I don't care what you say anymore.
Go ahead with your own life Leave me alone. (CHORUS SlNGlNG) Keep it to yourself It's my life.  Alan!
Alan! (SlNGlNG) Ave.  Maria
My God, he's got the voice of an angel. It's breathtaking.  Ave.
I can't believe my daddy is dead. (FEEDBACK OVER MlCROPHONE)
I can think of so many people I would rather have died first.
Like my mother.
As many of you know... my father and I were extremely close. He was my life partner.
He would often tell me, almost at a daily basis... that I was his favourite child.
I'll always remember the last words he said to me:
"I'm proud of you, Alan. Never change."  Well...
I heard you loud and clear, Daddy.
I will never change. Never, ever.
(FEEDBACK OVER MlCROPHONE) Oh, Mom.
Go ahead, chief. Sid Garner was a beloved husband... (SHUTTER CLlCKS)
Father and neighbour. Wow, rough day.
- Yeah, how's Tracy doing?
- Not great. Her mother's totally on the edge, and if all this weren't enough...
"apparently Alan's been off his meds for almost six months." Oh, bay.
Yeah, it has not been pretty. - Then there's the whole fucking giraffe thing.
- I thought that was pretty funny. - What?
- Come on!. He killed a giraffe. Who gives a fuck?
You know, I wasn't gonna say anything, but Alan's been stopping by my office lately.
You're kidding me. What for? I don't know.
He just sits in the waiting room and reads Highlights magazine.
Fills in the puzzles, whatever he can, and then... leaves. Check it out.
- Wow!.
- Jesus!, what are you gonna do with him?
Actually, I want to talk to you guys about that.
Linda really wants to stage an intervention for him. An intervention?
Really? I think that sounds like a great idea.
Yeah, the thing is... she's pretty convinced he won't agree to it unless all of us are there.
I mean, you know how he is.
I don't know. It seems a little extreme to me.
Oh, God!. Look at him now. Okay, I'm in.
When are we doing it?
So we talked to Tracy today... and she said that the treatment facility that they found is really nice.
It's beautiful. I checked it out online. Great reputation.
Who gives a fuck? It's in Arizona. We gotta go an like a two-day drive for this shit?
Here we go.
They should just save their money and send him to fat camp.
- Phil! - What? He´il lose weight.
The dude's lonely. If he's so lonely, why don't the you spend more time with him?
- No, trust me, you don't want that. - No!. You definitely don't want that.
Come on!. He's not that bad. I mean, what's the worst that's happened?
The tattoo? Yeah, the tattoo is the worst
Right?
Definitely. Tattoo was the worst.
Nightmare!
Speaking of which, you ever get tested? Excuse me?
You know, because of the ink. That went inside you.
I'm fine. - Take care. - All right, good luck tomorrow.
Again, thank you so much for coming. Oh, of course.
This is Nico. Nico is a good friend of Alan's.
- 'S-up, bros? - Oh, yeah, hey!.
And that's Blanca. Blanca's been with us since Alan was a baby.
- Hello. - Hello. And this is Timothy.
Timothy lives across the street. He and Alan swim together.
- Hey, what's up, little man? - Hey.
- Why don't you guys take a seat? - Yeah. Tracy's on her way back with Alan right now.
Obviously, he has no idea this is coming, so things might get a little intense.
But, no matter what happens, remember: This is all about Alan getting better.
Mother, Oreo smoothie, now! Oh.
- Hey, everyone. - Hey.
Hey, Timothy. Little cold for a swim, isn't it? Oh, wow.
Look. You went to the pier today. How was that?
I played skee ball for, like, 45 minutes. It was a pretty sick workout.
What's going on?
Uh, ahem, why don't you have a seat, bud? We just want to talk to you for a sec.
Okay. - Hey, Phil.
- Hey. Yeah. - Yeah.
Oh, you got me. (ALL LAUGHlNG)
So, Alan... we're all here to tell you about an awesome place... called New Horizons.
That does sound awesome. Alan, this is an intervention.
A what? Mom.
Alan.
"I love you so much. We all do."
But we can't keep lying to each other.
Ever since you were a baby, all I want- a...
Oh, my God!, is anybody else falling asleep?
Alan, listen!. - No offense, Mom, but you're boring.
- Mr. Alan. Oh, now you?
"I pick up after you for 30 years."
I cleaned your room. I see things no one should ever see.
But I pray for you. - Mr. Alan, everyone...
- Hey!. - Someone should clean that up.
- Alan!. Alan. You are not well.
You're off your meds and you're clearly upsetting your whole family.
- That's baloney.
- Alan, if you say yes to this... we drive you there today, and I promise you will come back a changed man.
Who's we? What do you mean, "we"? Who's we?
We!. All of us. Stu, Phil, me, you.
You going, Phil? I love you, Alan.
(CRYlNG) (CONTlNUES CRYlNG)  (HARRY NlLSSON'S "EVERYBODY'S TALKlN" ' PLAYlNG ON RADlO)
Hey, Alan, you hungry?
You wanna get some Arby's? No, thanks.
You know, I meant to tell you earlier, that's a really cool vest you got on. Thanks, Phil.
It was my dad's. He died in it.
Whoa!. That's intense.
Hey, Alan, just want to say what you're doing is really brave. We're proud of you.
Yeah, you're gonna do great. Stop the car.
I don't want to do this anymore. - What?
- I changed my mind. Alan, you can't change your mind.
Everybody's counting on you. I'm fine just the way I am.
I want to go home. Turn the car around. Now, please!
What the fuck was that? - Oh, my God!
He's doing it on purpose!
- Get out of his way! I am, I am!  - Hey!
Hey, get the fuck off! - You have to exchange information. Why?
Jesus. Phil! - Phil!
- Get away from him! - I'm trying! - Look out!
Go, go, go!
Lock your doors! Doug, lock your doors! Shit!
We're okay. - We're in an elevator! - Where are you?
- What the fuck is going on? (PHlL COUGHlNG)
Please, this is a huge mistake. You got the wrong guys!
I got the right fucking guys! Get him up. Pick him up.
- You're Black Doug! That's Black Doug! - Shut the fuck up with that.
Alan, tell me right now, why is Black Doug kidnapping us?
- I said don't call me that shit no more. - Sorry.
- It ain't Alan's fault. - Thank you, Black Doug.
- Motherfucker! - Doug!
Doug! -Okay. Okay,
Why are you doing this? - Because...  I told him to.
I'm Marshall.
And whether you know it or not... we all have something in common.
And it all started four years ago when this moron... sold the wrong drugs to this dumb fuck.
You have no idea the chain of events that were set in motion that night... in the parking lot of a fucking liquor store.
What up, nigga?
Excuse me?
Chill out, I'm not a cop. Just in town for the night.
Me and my boys looking to get a freak on. You sold Alan roofies.
Oh, shit.
I must've mixed up the bags. My fault, Alan.  Damn!.
Marshall gonna be pissed off at me on that one.
(ECHOlNG) Damn!. Marshall Gonna be pissed off at me on that one.
Marshall? You're Marshall.
You brought us out here because of that? (LAUGHS)
You're not here because of that.
You're here because some Chinaman I never heard of strolls into my town... and takes one of my guys off the street.
- Mr. Chow? - Yes.
Yes, Mr. Leslie fucking Chow.
You introduced a virus into my life.
Oh, God, what did he do? He fucked me in the ass.
Oh, he does that from time to time.
Not literally.
Jesus!
A few weeks after your bullshit, I get word... this Sheik is coming in from Abu Dhabi.
He was looking to make some less-than-legal investments.
He brought his two wives... and $42 million in gold bars. It was a lay-up.
Get down! Get down! We took it all.
Two vans, each with 21 million in gold.
My guys Split up.
One of them made it back... (SlREN WAlLING)
One of them didn't. Is there a problem, officer?
Not anymore, motherfucker. (LAUGHlNG)
Leslie Chow stole $21 million from me... on a Tuesday.
On, God.
I looked everywhere for him. But he's gone, no one can find him.
Until the little cockroach got himself pinched in Bangkok. So I pay him a visit.
I offer him a truce.
I won't touch a hair on his head. I just want him to tell me where my gold is.
He refuses to talk. Not only does he refuse to talk to me... he has no communication with anyone from the outside... except you!
Hey! Hey!
It's unfair!
Alan, you been talking to Chow? - They've been writing letters.
- Hey, those are private!
"Dear Leslie, OMG, the McRib is back!
Why was it ever gone?" Exactly!
"Dear Alan, I threw urine on prison guard today. Blamed it on cellmate.
Wish you were here." Yeah, I wish I could've seen that.
Letter after letter of total nonsense... except for one common thread:
You guys!
The Wolf Pack. Jesus Christ, Alan.
Five weeks ago, Chow escaped from maximum security detention.
Oh, fuck!.
He stowed aboard a shipping freighter bound for the West Coast. - Where is he?
- I don't know.
Alan, if you know where he is, you tell this man right now.
Phil, I don't know, I swear. I haven't talked to him in months. We gotta do it the hard way.
- Oh, no! - What the fuck? Hey!
- Let's go. - Hey! No!
Whoa, what are you doing? Doug is my insurance. He stays with me.
You don't give me Chow, I blow his brains out.
You go to the cops... I blow his brains out.
That's insane! We don't even know where the fuck he is! No one does.
But I figure the Wolf Pack has the best chance of finding him.
You have three days. Get to work.  Can you take Stu instead?
Fuck you, Alan. Shit.  Shit!
- Alan. - Yeah, Phil?
- I need you to roll over here and chew off these hand-ties. Okay.  - Oh.
- Got a little too much steam. - Get off me.
All right, let me just shimmy down.
- Would you just hold still? Hold still! - Aw.
(SHOUTlNG) Help! (SHOUTlNG) Help!  Holy shit!.
What are we gonna do, Stu?
- We're gonna go to the police.
- Oh, no, we're fucking not. Did you hear that guy?
He will kill Doug, period.
Chow is a cancer. He has been a cancer since the first day we met him.
We're gonna hand him over this guy, Marshall, and then it's done. - Hey, Phil.
- Alan, not now. But I need you, Stu. I can't do this alone.
Do what alone? We have no idea where he even is. - Phil.
- What, Alan?
I was gonna say I got this strange e-mail the other day.
I wasn't sure what it meant, but now I think it might be from Chow. "Fatty, it feels good to be out."
I'm close by. Tell no one. I'll be in touch.
"Chow." This says "Chow."
How did you not know this was from Chow?
At the time, I thought it was "Chow" like "goodbye"
You know, like, "Chow, arrivederci" - You know, Sparrow, Papa John's. - I'm writing him back.
Whoa, wait, wait. Just hold on.
Gonna tell him you're happy he's out and you'd love to see him. Ooh, I would love to see him.
Do you even know what's going on? Yes, I do.
Phil's doing all the work, I'm his assistant... you're standing there looking like an idiot.
I'm gonna arrange a meeting...
- ...and we're gonna take him out. - "Take him out"?
Who says that? How do we take someone out?
We use drugs. Prescription drugs.
You know, the kind a dentist has access to.
Good luck finding a dentist who will write fake prescriptions.
Oh, I know one. His name is Stuart Price. Now let's go find a fucking pharmacy.
Whoo! You just got schooled, son.
Are you coming or not? I don't like this plan.
Okay, then. Ciao. (ALAN LAUGHS)
I got a pretty dope sense of humour, bro! (ALAN CONTlNUES LAUGHlNG)
This amount with syringes is just weird. Gotta check it out. Everything okay?
Well, it's just a strange request.
This drug in this amount and a pack of syringes.
- It's just a little weird. - Yeah.
It's just kind of an emergency, so...
See, that right there, and you're acting all fidgety, plus you look like shit... in our business, these are all red flags.
I need to call the doctor, make sure everything's okay. Aha!.
Well! You're in luck, because I actually am the prescribing doctor.
Oh, boy. Another red flag. It says here you're a dentist.
Yeah.
Doctor of Dental Science.
This is fucked up.
Hey, Dad? I think we got a live one.  How'd we do'?
We did good.
I got Demerol, a pack of syringes... and almost lost my dental license.
- What about Chow? Anything? - No.
Oh, look at this. He e-mailed me like 20 minutes ago.
Alan, we've been sit... Give me the phone, please.
- What does it say? - Oh, wow. He wants to meet Alan tonight at 8.
It says came alone. - Came alone where?
- A bus stop. In Tijuana.
Tijuana's the bomb.
Oh, fuck. No, that's perfect.
No, it's like a three-hour drive from here. Yeah, Stu, try reading a map.
Yeah, Alan, try reading anything ever.
Yeah, Stu, try not having such big horse teeth. All right, we need a plan.
They're meeting on a bus bench in a public place... so Alan needs to convince Chow to go some place more private.
Some place where we can sneak up on him and drug him.
Like where? I don't know, like an alley.
What about a movie theater?
Fuck, that's actually a great idea.
The lights go down... we take the seats behind him, we jab him and it's fucking done.
I'll jab him if you want. I've drugged people before.
Yeah, us. No offense, but we're not letting you handle any drugs.
You'll kill someone. Oh, please, I'm an expert.
Remember the marshmallows in Thailand? Yeah?
I made it so you could eat at least three before hitting a fatal dose.
Wai.
So you're saying I would've died if I had had four?
Nobody eats four marshmallows, Stu.
That insane theory is the only reason I'm still alive?
Yes! And you're welcome, by the way.
Don't say "you're welcome" for almost killing me.
- Fine. - Thank you. - You're welcome.
On, God!.
You know, you were right. - About what?
- That place in Arizona.
It's not gonna help him.
There is no facility that can fix this guy.
We're gonna spend the rest of our lives dealing with him... "because, we're all he has now."
You realize that? We're it.
Oh, shit, check it out.
Is that Chow? Hey, fat stuff.
- Leslie. - Ta-Ta-Ta. - Act cool.
- Yeah, okay. - Anyone follow you? - No, I don't think so.
Good, good.
Gotta keep low profile right now. Chow wanted man.
Can't trust anyone. Quick, give me some sugar.
Come on, come on, come on. What the fuck?!
Did he just kiss him?
Listen, I'm in a bit of a pickle, Alan. - I need a friend.
- Well, I'm your friend, Leslie. Exactly. That's why I called you down here.
You're the only person I can trust in this shit-hole of a life.
That's not true. Stu and Phil are your friends.
Oh, really? That's interesting.
Where are they? - Around.
- Around where?
I don't know. - Motherfucker!
I told you to come alone!
- Leslie!. Shit!.
- What happened? - Is he leaving?
ALAN: We'll talk more! I'll give you another kiss!
He's coming this way. Get down. Get down.
- Fuck!. - Leslie! Oh, fuck.
- Get out of the car, you mutts! - Leslie, no! - Get off me, fat clown!
- Chow! Chow, calm down! - Who sent you?
- No one! No. - We just wanted to see you!
No one wants to see Chow! No, we...
We miss you. - What? - We miss you, Chow!
- That's it. - Yeah. We miss you.
You miss me? So much.  You miss Chow.
Yeah, buddy.
We love you, Chow. I hurt myself today.
To see if I still feel.
I focus on the pain. The only thing that's real.
What have I become.
What the fuck am I watching?
My sweetest friend. Everyone I know.  Goes away in the end.
- Is that gonna be enough? - Oh, yeah. This will take about a minute to kick in.
We'll tell the waitress he's drunk.
By the time we get to the car, he'll be out cold. My empire of dirt.
I will let you down. I will make you hurt  Alan, sit dawn.
That was really nice, Chow. Thanks, Phil.
The key is to sing from your heart.
So Mexico, huh? What are you doing down here?
You know, fucking, doing blow. Same old, same old.
Ooh, I got into cockfighting. - Oh, cockfighting. That sounds wonderful.
- Yeees. Basically, been killing it down here.
That is just terrific.
Right? I mean, that's terrific.
I think that calls for a toast. I like that.
- To killing it. - Killing it.
Yeah, to killing it. Mm.  You okay, Chow?
I don't know. You tell me. (CHUCKLES)
So how many roaster birds do you have, Chow? - Aah! - Huh?
- Shh. Act cool or I open his vein. - Oh, my God.
564 00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,120 Why you wanna drug poor Chow? No, no. It's not what you think.
There's this guy Marshall. Marshall? How you know that fat fuck?
He says you took his gold. He's got Doug. He'll kill him unless we bring you back.
It's true! I swear to God, it's true! Chow.
Chow, that's the truth. God damn it!
That motherfucker.
Stu, you okay?
- You all right? - No.
We're sorry, Chow. We're sorry.
- We didn't know what else to do. - Next time, don't lie to Chow.
You're right. You are so right, and we made a huge mistake. Se, what do we do now?
That depends.
Can I trust you? What is this place, Chow?
My house.
Chow used to be on top of the world.
Had three beautiful homes in three different countries.
But this one, my Mexican villa... this was my favourite.
And everything got fucked.
Chow go to prison, all my property seized.
My homes... sold at auction to highest bidders.
But I know something no one else knows.
This house is where I stashed the gold.
- Marshall's gold? - Yep.
Hid it inside the basement wall.
No one knows it's there.
We're gonna go get it.
Wait. You mean break in?
Look, Marshall wants his gold.
And he's gonna hunt me down until he gets it. If we show up without it, he'll kill me.
We're not breaking in anywhere. Not anywhere, Stu.
My house. It's piece of cake.
I know every square inch of this place.
The best part, the guy we're stealing it from doesn't even know it's there.
So he'll never know it's gone. You guys know what's going on, right?
What do you mean? Well, and please correct me if I'm wrong, we're not breaking into this house.
This house is too small. We're breaking into another house.
This is just a model, right? What? Alan, no!
My chickens! (PHlL GRUNTlNG AND STU SCREAMlNG)  Oh, shit!
Chow, what the fuck? Watch out for the claws! They're trained to kill!
His beak is so sharp! Ow! Ow!
- Stay still, I'm trying to help. - Don't!
- Get it off! - Fucking bull's-eye!
- Are you out of your mind?
Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it!
Stu, the window! - Get it out!
- Okay, okay! Get it out!  Shh, shh, shh.
Don't struggle. Let go. You won a lot of fights, Wallace.
Not this time. (GRUNTlNG)  - What the fuck is wrong with those chickens?
- They're angry.
All I feed them is cocaine.
And chicken. (CHOW LAUGHS)  That's some house, Chow.
It was my Shangri-La.
Now it's gone.
Could you not spit inside my minivan, please? Jesus!.
Who lives there new? Some dot-com millionaire. He's never here.
This is a vacation home. The help doesn't show up on Sundays.
No one there but the guard dogs. Stu?
We'll toss these burgers over the gate, wait for the Demerol to kick in.
Make sure you put in enough to kill them.
We're not gonna kill the dogs, Chow. This will knock´em out for hours.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you worked for PETA. - What a pussy.
Alan, take that. Aah!  (GRUNTlNG)
- Where are you going? - You'll see.
Pardon me, little loser. Excuse me, fucking asshole.
Follow me. Okay, here´s the deal:
Two security panels inside.
If you cut only one wire, it triggers alarm.
Place will be crawling with cops.
But if you cut wire on both panels at same time, alarm disabled.
Yeah, but how are we gonna get inside without tripping the alarm?
Check this out. (CHOW CHUCKLES)
- Any more stupid questions? - Whoa.
Now, who's coming with me?
I'll do it. You wanna tell him?  Oh, um...
Alan, you're just too fat.
Roger that. OW. Ahh.
You kicked me, you motherfucker. No, no, no.
Don't get up. Will trip motion detectors. Stay low like dog.
Good idea. - Which way? - In there.
Aah! What the fuck is that? Ha, ha.
We're dogs, remember? (CHOW LAUGHS)  Hey, Stu?
Check it out.
Oh, my God! So gross! (RETCHES) (LAUGHlNG)
Chow, cut it out! Okay, I'm here.
Now what?
Pull the cover off so you can see the wires. Okay.  Okay.
Done!
Okay, on three, cut the gray wire.
One, two...
Wait. Wait, wait, wait! I don't have a gray wire.
I have red, green and yellow. That's weird. I have light gray, medium gray, dark gray.
You do? Motherfucker.
My bad. I'm colour-blind. You're what?
Fuck it, just cut the middle one.
No, my middle one could be different. The wires are all twisted.
- On three. One, two... - Chow, stop!
God.
Hold on, I'm coming to you. What the fuck's taking them so long?
Where'd you get that shirt, the Diesel store? Phil.
What?
It's a cute top. Where did you get that shirt? What's the problem?
Just point to the wire you want me to cut.
- This gray one right here. - Great.
For your information, that's green. Och, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Which one's red'? The one in your left hand.
- Wait, which hand is that?
I'm also dyslexic. - What the fuck? - Where'd you get it?
- I don't know. I'll find out, I'll get you one.
There's a cool Diesel store in the mall that I like to go to.
Right next to the food court. I don't know if it's Diesel.
Looks like a Diesel. What's the matter with you?
Okay, you're still holding the one I left you with, right?
Oh, fuck. All right. On three!
"two..." three.
(SlGHS)
Holy shit, it worked. All good?
- Easy peasy. - All right.
You have no idea. Come on.
Whoops. Jesus, be careful, Chow.
Ha, ha. Fuck this guy.
Living in my house. Living my life.
Can we just stick to the plan? Fine.  Ha, ha.
Ruined.
He is completely out of control. Let's just get this done.  This way.
Come on, come on. It's buried behind this wall.
- Alan.
- Here you go, boss. Aah!  Fuck!
- You okay'? - Yeah, I'm okay. Just warming up.
It's so heavy. Do we have a lighter one?
- Why don't you just let me do it, Chow? - Okay. Either way, you or me.
You might wanna take your shirt off. Makes it easier.
- What? - I've heard that too. (PANTlNG)
See that? Chow come back for you. That's the last of it.
You sure? - Yeah.
- You triple sure'?
- Yes! - Good! Heh-heh-heh.
Chow? Chow?  Chow!
Chow! Chow!  Chow, open this fucking door right now!
Chow! (ALARM BLARlNG)  Stuart Price.
No felonies. One arrest:
Las Vegas, Nevada. Phil Wenneck.
No felonies. One arrest:
Also Las Vegas, Nevada. Alan Garner.
Is this record accurate? Uh-huh.
I did that.
Mm-hm. Yeah.
Masturbating on a city bus. Yep, that was me.
Look, we've been here for 5 hours. We already told your guys everything.
No. You told them a story about a little Chinese man.
Leslie Chow. He's an international criminal. Look it up.
A little Chinese man that no one in town has seen or heard of.
The hotel where you say he's staying? No one there.
Probably because he left town.
That's one theory. Another theory is that you're lying.  (ALAN LAUGHlNG)
"Lewd behaviour, Cracker Barrel, Christmas Eve." (SPEAKlNG IN SPANlSH)
Excuse me. We're fucking dead.
Why would Mr. Chow do this?
Because he's a greedy piece of shit who used us.
- Yeah, but he's our friend. - Oh. Grow up, Alan.
You're free to leave.
All the charges have been dropped.
By Who? It's your lucky day.
There's a car waiting for you out front.
Come on, let's go. Oh, Jesus.
What? I'm sorry.
What is this? Get in the car.  Excuse me, sir?
Where we headed? (DOORS LOCK)  Welcome back.
- What the fuck?
- Let's go, guys. Out to the back.
- Doug?
- Guys. Careful.
Get your ass back over here.
Leslie Chow never lived here.
You didn't break into his old house.
You break into my house. I don't understand.
You didn't get back the gold he stole from me.
You got the other half that he didn't.
Oh, my God!
What, you mean the half he never had?
He's a world-class rat, and you three were his accomplices. - No!
- We had no idea. We were trying to help you. We thought you'd be happy!
Thank you so much. Thank you for ripping me off.
Thank you for desecrating my home!
And thank you for killing my fucking dogs!
We didn't kill your dogs. They're just tranquilized.
Oh, right.
You don't know. - Chow snapped their necks on his way out.
- What'? And somebody's gotta pay.
- He's right. - No, no, no! Aah!
My head of security.
Couldn't stop three fuckups and a Chinaman with a pair of wire cutters.
Unreal. Aw.
Man.
That's okay. I know it's scary. Hector.
Run upstairs and grab a pair of sweatpants for Alan here.
I'm a 44 slim. Can you bring me a few options?
You found Chow once. Find him again.
And my gold. Wait.
We don't even have a car.
Chow stole my minivan. Take the limo.
Hector has the keys. And get going.
I'm killing Dougs today. - I never saw anyone get killed before.
- Right?
My God, that was so intense.
I mean, he just fell and then he's dead.
I feel sick. Me too.
Well, maybe we should get some food, guys. What are we gonna do?
We have no idea where Chow is.
I don't know.
He took your minivan. We could report it stolen... and then they could track him down?
It's worth a shot. Oh, fuck!
I left my phone in the minivan.
Well, if you lost your phone, Phil, I have that Find My Phone app.
We have bigger problems than that, Alan.
No, wait, wait, wait.
If your phone's in the minivan... and Chow has the minivan, then your phone's with Chow!
You heard him. We have bigger problems than that, Stu.
Alan, give me your phone. Quick.
- That's brilliant. - Yes.
- Wait, what's your password? - "Hey Phil."
- Yeah? - No, that's it. - What?
- That's my password. "Hey Phil."  It is it.
Phil gets it.
Nothing worse than losing your phone.
You just saw a man get murdered. Your brother-in-law is kidnapped.
You sure there's nothing worse?
You don't get it, Stu. You just don't get it, do you?
I have over 60 apps on that phone.
What if I lost my phone?
Do you have any idea how much time and man-hours it would take... to re-download those apps? You are right.
I had not thought of that. Thank you.
Oh, God, it's not always about you, Stu! It's locating.  - Oh, God, of course.
- What?
Where is he? He's in fucking Vegas.
- Shotgun. - Oh. Oh, no.
Hey, Stu? I don't enjoy talking to you that way.
I don't know why you insist on making me blow my top.
We've been on a lot of adventures together... but it seems like you haven't learned anything.
Anything! You think on it.
I'll be in the limo. He's okay.
Someone needs to burn this place to the ground.
I told myself I would never come back.
Well, don't worry. It all ends tonight.
It says 200 yards up on the right.
And there it is. Amazing.  Looks like he ditched it.
- It's open. - No shit.
We´il, look around. Let's see if he left anything in here.  - I found the Demerol.
- Good. Keep it, we're gonna need it.
I got my phone. No fucking keys, though.
- Alan, anything? - No, not even the gold.
- Why the fuck would Chow come down here? - I know, right?
Why here? (ANNOUNCER ON TV):
You can't match the pure strength and power... of John Gena! - Gena pubs Punk down! - Oh!
Ha, ha. Nice!  Excuse me.
Have you happened to see the driver... of that minivan that's parked out front?
Short Asian guy? Yeah, they're all short.  Ha, ha.
That's so true.
Right, but he may have been trying to pawn some gold.
That would be my business, wouldn't it?
I like your T-shirt. I saw that show at the Forum.
He played "Captain Jack."
Yeah, I heard that was legendary.
Woman... you have no idea.
Try me. Cassie, I'm hungry.
I thought you ordered Chinese.
Mom, I'm with a customer! - You'll eat when I say it's time to eat!
- But the doctor...
If you don't reverse that right now, there's gonna be hell to pay.
(LAUGHS) (ALAN CONTlNUES LAUGHlNG)
She's rude. Thank you.
Yeah, you hear that, Ma? Nobody likes you!
Yeah, keep your mouth shut! Whoa.  You're smart.
A Chinese guy came in here earlier. It was pretty weird.
He pawned a gold brick.
The thing's worth 400 grand, he tuck 18,000. - Did he say where he was going?
- I'm sorry, was I talking to you? He said he wanted three things:
He wanted some girls, some guys and some bath salts.
I gave him a card for an escort service and he took off.
Pretty high-end, so good luck getting anything out of them.
Thank you. (RETCHES)  We gotta go.
We should go. - Yeah. - Yeah.
I'll get it, I'll get it. I'll get it. Anything?
No, I'm still an hold. Oh, look how happy this fucking guy is.
Have you ever witnessed a moment with that much heat?
I mean, white-hot heat, bro!
No, it was pretty intense. Yeah!
Yeah, it's actually an emergency. He has a thick Asian accent.
I totally get it... but this is a highly unusual circumstance and... Okay.
All right.
It's an escort service. They're not gonna tell us shit.  Maybe an escort would.
- You still have her number?
- Yeah, but... it'd be pretty awkward. It's all we got.
She smiled at me again, from inside the shop. Ha, ha.
This is the best day of my life. (DOORBELL RlNGS)
Hey! Oh, my God, you guys.
It's been so long.
- Come in, come in. - Thank you.
- You look great. - So do you! You're pregnant.
I feel so fat. Oh, please.
Do you guys mind taking your shoes off? I'm a germ freak.
- Yeah, sure. - Of course. Alan.
Alan, what are you doing?
Sorry.
- Wow, you have a great house. - Thank you.
I got married a year ago to a surgeon.
- Another doctor, can you believe it? - Another doctor.
His name's Jeff. You guys would love him.
Tyler, say hi to Mommy's friends. Hi.  Hey!
Wait, is that the baby? Yeah, time flies, huh?  Wow.
Listen Jade, is there a place we could talk that's a little bit more private?
Let's go in the kitchen. You guys want coffee?
Perfect. Hey.
You coming?
Hey Jade, is it okay if I go say hello to the little guy? Of course.  Nice stuff.
Thanks.
Jeff bought it for me. Jeff.
Who's that, your fake dad? Your name was Carlos once.
Did you know that?
No. Well, it was.
And, frankly, it suits you better.
Okay. Do you remember me?
No. Are you my real dad?
Yes.
I don't know. You gotta understand, I've been out of that world a few years now.
Yeah, of course. We totally get that.
I mean, Jeff knows everything and he's cool, but...
We're just asking if you can call around... just find out if anybody might know where he is.
We could really use your help.
You used to love it when I would carry you around.
Sometimes I can still feel your little head on my chest. So do you like this new Jeff guy?
Yeah, he's nice.
My dad was nice too. We did everything together.
He was my life partner, hah. I really let him down.
Okay. Wow.
Just trust me, you don't want to go over there, okay? Not this one.
I love you too.
She says there's this crazy Chinese guy... and he's holed up in the penthouse suite of Caesars Palace.
There's girls going in and out, drugs everywhere...
It sounds like a bad scene.
Hey, Alan? We gotta go.  I gotta go, little man.
It was great talking to you.
High five. - It's great to see you.
- You too, Jade.
- Thanks so much for your help. - Yeah.
That's a great kid you got there. He is the best.
Alan. Oh, hold on.
I have something for you. Perfect.
Oh, please.
I'll see you around, Carlos. (PHONE RlNGS)
- Yeah. - We got him.
- Great. Where is he? - Caesars Palace.
Change of plans. Tell him we're going to Vegas.
I´m on my way
There's a spot just outside of town. I'll text you the details. Be there at 6 a.m.
And make sure the little fucker's tied up. We don't have him.
Hey, Marshall, it's Phil.
Maybe Stu wasn't clear. We don't actually have Chow, we just know where he is.
Yeah, and we were hoping that you and your guys... - ...could go to Caesars and get him.
- I don't give a fuck what you were hoping. The deal is you bring Chow to me.  - Oh, fuck.
- 6 a.m. or your friend is dead. Shit.  Oh, God.
This place gives me the chills. I know, right?
It's great to be back.
- So many good memories. - Are you kidding me?
Okay, so here's the deal:
You need a key just to get onto his floor. And then once you're there, he's got security posted at the door.
It's ridiculous. Let me guess, that's him?  Yep.
The one with the strobe lights.
I got an idea.
But you're not gonna like it. It's not gonna work.
Not with that fucking attitude.
You know this whole place is made out of marbles? Come on. Go, go, go.
After we stick Chow, Alan and I are gonna take him down through the lobby.
Be waiting in valet. Engine running, ready to go.
Are you sure about this? Give me the Demerol.  See you in 20 minutes.
- Hey, Phil? - Yeah?
Don't die. (RAKlM MAYERS' "FUCKlN' PROBLEMS" PLAYlNG ON STEREO)  All right.
Are you ready to do this?
Yeah.
Wait, what are we doing? Holy shit.  We're gonna climb down... and then it's about an 8-foot drop to the balcony.
- All right? - Yeah. No, you spit in your own hand.
Oh, yeah. (ALAN SNORTlNG)  (CONTlNUES SNORTlNG)
Dry desert air.
- Alan, it's fine. You don't need it. - Okay.
Oh, God. - Unh!
- Careful! - Phil!
- I'm all right. I'm okay!
- Hey, Phil. - What's wrong?
Hold on a second.
- What'? - Hold on! Like, kick yourself out a little bit.
Alan. - Stay still! - Alan!
Did you get it? No. Hold on.
Ha, that's cool, ha-ha-ha. Oh!
Fuck me! Everything all right?
It's okay!
It's all right! I got it! Whoa.
Are you okay? (RAKlM MAYERS' "FUCKlN' PROBLEMS" CONTlNUES PLAYlNG ON STEREO)
Alan, it's your turn. That's it.
Phil, I can't. I can't. Come on.
Whoa! Alan, you all right?  Phil, call Security!
- I think it's slipping! - Just hold on!
Oh! God!
- You need to calm down. - I'm slipping, Phil! Oh!
Oh, shit! You okay? Help!
I'm gonna die, Phil. No, you're fine.
Just... Drop down to me.  Not a chance.
I'm good up here.
Alan, you can do this. I'll catch you. Just...
let go. That's it.
That's it. Just drop straight down.
But don't push off.
No! - Oh, God!
- Come here! Holy fuck!
You okay?
Yeah.
Shit. Oh, fuck.
I almost died, Phil. Come on.
I wasn't gonna let you go. You're my boy.
And you're my man.
Alan, what are you doing? Alan. Okay.
Let's go get this fucker.
(BLACK SABBATH'S "N.l. B." PLAYlNG OVER STEREO)
Hey!
Have you seen my...? Huh?  Phil!
Motherfuckers!
Grab the gun! - Oh, fuck!
- Phil! Oh.
Phil, you okay? Chow!
Chow! (GRUNTS)
Chow, open the fucking door! Fuck.  (GlRLS SCREAMlNG)
Chow, stop. You motherfuckers!
Leslie, get down from there! Please! You're gonna hurt yourself!
Nothing hurts Chow. I am invisible!
It's "invincible," and you're not. You're just out of your fucking mind.
Now get down from there before you die!
Die? How do you kill what's already dead? Heh-heh-heh.
- Hey. You okay? - No.
(STU GASPS) What the fuck is that?  - That's Chow!
- What? Follow him.  Woo-hoo!
(LAUGHlNG) I love cocaine!
Out of the way! (PEOPLE SCREAMlNG)
How did this happen?
We had him trapped, and then he jumped! He's out of his fucking mind!
I'm out of my fucking mind! (CHOW LAUGHlNG)  Wow.
So beautiful. Stu, do not lose him.
I'm trying. Whoa!  (STU SlGHS)
On, shit. (CHOW SlNGlNG) I believe I can fly.  I believe I can touch the sky.
We gotta pack up all this gold. We're taking it with us.
Talk to me, Stu. I got him.
Ha, ha. I got him! On, shit!
Shit.
Fuck! I lost him!
Don't tell me that. You can't lose him!
This is so much harder than you realize, Phil. I'm just a dentist!
No, Stu, you're a fucking doctor. Now go get him. Where the fuck did he go?
Fuck me!
I should have thought this through!
Shit! (CHOW GRUNTS)
Move! - Aah!
- Stu? - Chow?
- Stop the fucking car! - Stu.
- I can't! The pedal is stuck!
- What? - Stu? (CHOW SCREAMlNG)
- I can't see! - Stop, motherfucker!
- Get off! - Pull over! - It won't stop!
Get off the car! I can't see anything!  Ha-ha-ha.
Holy shit!. Stu? Stu, what happened?
Stu, what's going on?
We had an accident, and I think he's dead.
Wait, what? I think I killed him.  Holy shit.
He's not moving.
Oh, fuck. Mr. Chow?
Chow. (CHOW COUGHlNG)  Stuart?
He's alive. He's okay. Oh, great.
Put him in the limo and come get us.
We'll meet you at valet. Yeah, okay.  Stu.
That was some ride, huh, pal?
Yeah, it was pretty wild. I can't feel my nuts.
Would you rub them and make sure they okay?
It's over, Leslie. Wait.
Let's make a deal.
Want Chow to blow your dick? Come on, Stu.
I could be a good wife to you.
- No more deals. - No, wait! Let's put the bags in the back seat.
Trunk's full. (THUMPlNG FROM TRUNK)
Hey, guys? I'm feeling better now.
All right, it's the next exit, then four miles straight into the desert.
Tell you what Let me out, we split the gold four ways. Everyone wins (THUMPlNG FROM TRUNK)
Marshall gonna kill me! My blood will be on your hands!
You want Chow's ghost haunting you for rest of your life, Stu?
Floating over you while you make fuck on your wife?
He's not gonna kill you, Chow! He just wants his gold back!
It's gone. I blew the first 20 million in Bangkok.
- That's why I had to get the other half. - Enough, Chow! It's over!
You motherfucker! When I get out of this, I'm gonna rip out your fucking lungs!
You hear me? You're dead! You're all dead!
I didn't mean that. Chow loses temper sometimes.
Please. I need help. I know that now.
That's the exit. They're here.
Alan, they're coming, grab the last bag. Please, Alan.  Doug!
Step away from the bags. Let's go! We good?
- It's all there.
I promise. - Not exactly. I'm still missing the original half.
But, no, that's all we have.
Chow said he blew the other half in Bangkok. Where is he?
He's in the trunk. Deal's a deal.
- Doug.
- Give me the keys. What are you gonna do with Chow?
I just wanna talk to him.
Move. You all right?  What the fuck?
End of conversation.
Why would you do that?
Leslie Chow is madness.
You don't talk to madness.
If you're lucky, you trap it in the trunk of your limo and you kill it.
You did a great thing tonight. You should feel good about this.  What the fuck?
You think this is a fucking game? Don't, don't, don't!  On, shit!
Toddle-doo, motherfuckers. Chow.  Chow.
Chow, wait.
Oh, now you wanna talk, blue eyes? No more silent treatment?
Leslie. No.
Stay out of this, fatty. No, Leslie.
You shoot Phil, you gotta go through me.
What? - Alan.
- Quiet. I'm in a stare-off.  Today you all live.
Because one of you was a friend. Alan, what did you do?
I unlocked the latch between the back seat and the trunk.
And left him his gun? Yeah, I didn't think it all the way through.
He gave Chow a fighting chance.
That's all I ever need. Fat fuck.
It's never easy, is it? No one wants to see that.
Except for me, but I was born bad.
Hold on. I have something for you. For your loyalty.
- Oh, no, I don't want this, Mr. Chow.
- Okay, give it back, then. Come on.
Quick! Before Stu smells it.
I don't want it either, Chow. Oh, please. Like a squirrel doesn't want a nut.
(CHOW LAUGHlNG) It funny because he's Jewish.  Don't you get it?
Goddamn it.
Okay, go on.
Get out of here, all of you. Hey, chubster, I'll call you in a week.
We'll get together. No, Leslie, we can't be friends anymore.
What?
You're not good for me. It's not healthy.
Alan, you're not thinking straight.
Let's just talk tomorrow.
Leslie, you're one of the coolest and nicest guys I've ever met.
And you're smart and you're funny and everybody loves you.
Alan. What is this?
When we get together, bad things happen and people get hurt.
Yeah, that's the point. It's funny.
Well, I've gotta make some changes in my life, and this is one of them. I'm sorry.
Farewell, Leslie Chow. You're cold as ice.
Shotgun. (PHlL SlGHS)  Everybody okay?
Yeah.
Alan, you okay?
Yeah. Good.
Let's go home. Jesus Christ.
You know what, guys?
You can go ahead without me. There's something I need to do.
Do you even know how to get home? Of course I do.
I'm a grown man. I'll ask a stranger.  Good luck, Alan.
We'll see you soon.
Did you know that just a couple blocks from here... there's a place that looks exactly like Paris, France?
I can't remember what it's called, but it's supposed to be magnificent.
It's called Paris Hotel and Casino, and it is magnificent.
Yeah, that's it. Well, I'd like to take you to dinner there. Tonight.
Oh, sorry. No can do. Oh, well...
I'm banned from the casino for life. Plus 10 years.
I took Mom there for her birthday, played a little blackjack.
She split 10s. - Oh. - I may have overreacted.
I've done that. Heh. Right?
I can't go back there. But, uh...
Golden Nugget has the best prime rib in town, if that's...
Well, that sounds glorious.
I'll send for you at 8:00. Is that it'?
(BOTH CHUCKLE) I saw it once in a pornography.
Oh.
It's a nice gesture. But maybe we should wait.  Oh.
Okay. Yeah, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
I'll see you at 8. You look great, Alan.
What do you think? Hat or no hat? Uh...
- Hat. For sure. - Oh, yeah.
Wow. Who's this guy? The vest and the cane?
I love it. Thank you. Cassie picked it out for me.
You look like Mr. Peanut. Yeah, I know, right? That's what I was going for.
- Maybe we'll just lose it. - Yeah. Hey, Alan, I was just talking to Cassie.
Oh, thank you for saying that. She is an amazing woman. I find her much better than your wives.
Aw. That's sweet. Which reminds me.
Um, we need to talk. Doug? All right, listen, fellas.
Now that I'm getting married, I'm gonna be spending a lot more time with Cassandra.
It's the way it should be. - No, you slow your roll, Phil, okay?
There's more. And you're not gonna like this part.
I must resign from the wolf pack.
Wow, that's a big step, Alan.
I know. But she's my soul mate.
And my new best friend.
Plus, she lets me mount her... which relaxes me.
Oh, my God. Alan, maybe never say that part again.
Chillax, Doug, we're all adults here.
I know you mount my sister. I've seen it. Many times.
What? Alan, you are the best.
The point is: You need to let me go.
You in particular. I can't be your hero anymore.  Okay.
Sure. Having said all that...
I still would like to get together on Tuesdays for bowling... and alternating Sundays for general horseplay.
- How about we play all that by ear? - Alan, it's time.
Here we go. Ready?  (SlGHS)
I'm ready.
Nica?
Nica.
There's somebody at the door. I'm busy. Nica, please.
God!
What are you doing that's so important?
I was playing solitaire.
The computer cheats, you know. Yeah, well, I'm used to that.  Morning.
Hi.
Got a delivery for Mrs. Sarah Pierce? I'll...
I'll sign for it. Cool.  Whoa.
You know, you don't look like a Mrs.
Oh, I'm... I'm not.
It's for my mother. Oh, God.
I'm back living with my mother, too.
It's just a fucking nightmare, right? You have no idea.
Wait a minute.
Oh, my God. I know you.
Yeah, yeah.
It was, uh, City College. The Psych Department, right?
That was me.
Well, when'd you graduate?
I didn't. I never completed my thesis.
Oh, on what? Uh... Completion anxiety.
Thought only guys got that.
So, is your mom home now or what?
Yeah.
Too bad.
Well, uh, see you around.
Bye.
Was that guy hitting on me?
Baby, you're beautiful.
Thank you. But I... I think that guy was hitting on me.
Maybe I should go ask him out. Nica.  He was just being nice.
I'm sorry.
Oh, honey, I just don't ever want to see you get hurt. I thought you swore off the Home Shopping Network.
I haven't bought anything in three weeks.
Maybe you have a secret admirer. You sound threatened.
No. Not at all.
I just wouldn't want to see you get hurt. Who's it from?
It doesn't say.
Must be some kind of joke.
I don't get it.
Neither do I. He's cute.
If you say so.
Hi.
I'm Chucky. Wanna play? Alice will love him.
I DVR'd Real Housewives.
I'm going to make tuna melts later. Okay? Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Oh, God.
Mom!
No. I need an ambulance right away.
It's my mother. I don't know.
I don't know. There's so much blood. Nica.
I'm sorry.
She was fine.
She was taking her meds, she was painting again. No.
No. She was fine.  How could she do that, Barbie?
How could she do that to herself?
You, uh...
You remember Father Frank. Uh... Yes.
Hello, Father.
I'm so very sorry for your loss, Nica.
Thank you.
Your sister just thought it might be a good idea for me to come.
I appreciate it.
But you know my mother and I both left the church a long time ago.
But not in the eyes of God.
I just thought it might be nice for us to have someone to talk to. We have each other.
Nica.
We have to pray for her.
To be forgiven. She was sick.
You can't judge her.
No one is judging her.
In fact, the church's official response to a situation like this is not to judge, but to pity.
My mother and I have had quite enough pity, thank you.
I understand. It was my fault.
I should have seen it coming.
Nica, you cannot blame yourself.
She was supposed to be taking care of you. Hey.
Hey, Ian.
Gimme a hug. Is that a new chair?
Uh, yeah. - It's cool.
- Thank you.
Uh, this... This is Jill, my new au pair.
No, I'm just the nanny. Hi.
I'm so sorry, Nica.
Thank you. I'm, uh, I'm glad you're here. Come here, you.
Oh...
I'm so happy to see you. Me, too.  Did Grandma go to heaven?
Yes, sweetie, she did.
Hey, I have a surprise for you. That's funny.
Oh, Mommy, I have to go to the bathroom.
Okay. Jill will take you. You show her the way.
Mommy needs to talk to Aunty Nica.
Jill, let's go. Um...
I think I'm going to go with them. Okay? Remember, you don't have to lock the door.
But somebody might come in.
We won't let anybody in.
But what about you guys? Hmm.
Honey, we really don't want to see you do your business.
Okay, bye.
So listen, how much is she paying you again? $400 a week.
That's more than I make.
Well, maybe you should consider a career change.
Hey, I'd be a great nanny. $400 a week!
Man. Yeah, but no benefits.  What's your name?
Alice?
Alice, open the door, honey! Alice?
Alice, open the door right now. He scared me half to death.
What is this?
Well, um, Mom left the house to both of us.
So? So.  I think we should consider selling.
What are you talking about?
Nica, this place is fabulous.
It's so much closer to us, we'd get to see you way more often.
And with your half of what we could get for the house, you'd be set for the rest of your life.
This isn't about me. This is about money. Well, you know we've been struggling.
Print media is dead.
Ian's working at Starbucks.
We're going to have to send Alice to public school.
And she so had her heart set on St. Bridget's.
I don't want to deprive my child.
You have a live-in nanny.
Well, actually, that's not really working out. Barb, this is my home.
Nica, I know this is hard.
But do you really think you can manage here all by yourself?
Mom would have wanted you to be taken care of.
That's all she ever wanted.
We're back.
You found him. He was in the bathroom.  Really?
You know, I think Grandma would have wanted you to take care of him.
It was obviously sent here by mistake. It must belong to someone else.
And Alice, you already have too many dolls as it is.
Yeah, but Chucky's my friend till the end!
I actually think it's a really nice gesture.
Thank you, Aunty Nica. It's a doll.
What's the worst that can happen, huh?
I like to be hugged.
I like to hug you, too, Chucky.
Mmm... What's that, Chucky?
Oh!
Chucky wants to know what's for dinner. Well.  I guess I better get started in the kitchen.
Oh, don't be silly.
Uh, you guys are my guests and you must be exhausted from your flight, please just make yourselves at home.
Father Frank, you will stay for dinner, won't you? Well, I, uh...
I'd love to, Nica. Thanks.
Uh, you're going to make dinner.
For six.
Seven.
Well, I will need a chef's assistant.
And Chucky can be my assistant. Great.
Let's get cooking. Mmm.
It's really good. It's the oregano.
Did you finish setting the table? Almost.  Pay the toll.
We're on a roll. Oh, no, honey, don't touch that.
Can you grab me the napkins?
The fancy ones from last Christmas. This smells delicious.
Thanks.
Come on, Chucky. Wow.
Look at this, Nica. You've really outdone yourself this time.
We are going to sit right here.
Barb, sit next to me here. Okay. If you insist.
Wow. Look at this.
Thanks, Jill. Make yourself comfortable. Oh.
You brought out the nice china. Father, would you like to say grace?
Bless us, oh Lord, and these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty.
Stop. Through Jesus Christ our Lord we pray. Amen.
Jill?
Mmm. Thank you, Ian.
Don't mind if I do. How about you, Father?
Oh, no. I'm good. I am starving.
Uh, wait.
Your daddy would like to make a toast.
To the chef.
Thank you. I had a great assistant. I love chili.
Do you really? Yeah.
Me, too. Love it. Is there meat in this?
No. Not at all.
It's vegetarian. Huh.  Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
What? This is amazing!  I know.
I can't believe there's no meat in this.
It's so hearty.
It's the oregano.
This is just the way my mama used to make it. Nica, could you pass me the salt?
Thank you.
You know, that doll, it looks really familiar somehow.
Oh, Father, come on.
Good Guy dolls were all the rage back in the '80s.
My brother even had one. So did mine.
Are you serious? Yes.
- Oh, come on.
- That is wild... I...
I seem to remember seeing them on the news?
I remember seeing people standing in line overnight just to get their hands on one of these.
They were right up there with Smurfs and Cabbage Patch Kids. Mmm.  Hmm.
Alice, honey, is something wrong? It tastes funny.
Maybe we put too much oregano in.
Alice, sweetheart, it's not that bad. Eat it.
Father, are you all right?
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry, I'm going to have to be going.
Oh, my God, Father, are you ill?
I have an appointment back at the church.
Nica, thank you so much, the chili was delicious. Father, are you?
No, please forgive me.
I don't mean to be rude.
I'll see you all in the morning at the cemetery. Uh...
Good night. I'm so sorry.
Where is he?
This way.
What happened? Lost control, hit them head on.
Probably drunk.
No, no, this isn't right. I know him, I'm in his parish.
He doesn't drink anymore. You sure about that?
He's my sponsor.
Stanton, you're going to need a drink after you see this. Jesus Christ.
Steel's got him pinned.
He's lost a shitload of blood, but we just can't tell from where.
Father, can you hear me? Father?
Just hang on! We're going to get you out.
What the hell are you waiting for? Get this shit off him!
I can't make that call. He's bleeding to death!
Get him out! - Okay, set in.
- On my count.
One, two, pull. Oh.  Oh.
This is an oldie. Oh, my God.
Is that you?
Shut up. You're so cute.
It's called baby fat. Look, I didn't say anything.
Go back to sleep.
Will do. Look at her.
She's so happy.
What happened to your dad?
He drowned that year, couple of weeks before Nica was born.
Mom was never the same after that.
Who's that?
Some neighbor back in Chicago, I guess.
What a weirdo.
Hey there, missy, what'cha up to?
Chucky's gone.
Not again. Well, where did you leave him?
I didn't. He's hiding. Okay, time for bed.
And don't forget to brush your teeth and your hair.
What about Chucky? Jill will go look for Chucky.  I'll give you a hand, Jill.
Uh-uh. We're not done here yet. I think he's hiding under my bed.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'm going to be right back.
Are you sure you didn't leave him downstairs?
I didn't leave him anywhere. He's hiding. There he goes!
I am not in the mood for this.
Need a hand?
I need a fucking search party!
I have looked over every inch of this house and I can't find him anywhere. God, I've missed you.
Shut up. Oh...  You found him.
I think she wanted you to find him.
You know, I haven't been spending enough time with her.
It's like if I'm not working, I'm just so tired all the time.
Life is short Did they always say that?
I don't know.
Listen, little man, what else are you, uh, telling my kid behind my back, huh?
I like to be hugged. Oh. And?
Hey. Wanna play?
Is that it? Hi.
I'm Chucky.
And I'm your friend till the end.
That one's a classic.
Ah... And it works on so many different levels.
Yeah, the '80s were awesome.
Did you find him yet? Yeah, we found him!
I'll take him up.
Ian?
Anyone?
Hello?
Oh, shit.
Coming!
See, with her, it's always something.
She needs my help and then resents me for it.
You're the only one who really appreciates me. You know, I was thinking.
Hmm?
We can get by without the money.
You don't have to sell.
I mean, this is her home. She's a mess.
You can see that. Oh, crap.
There you are, Chucky!
We've been looking for you everywhere. Hey, want to play?
I didn't know you could do that.
Playtime's over. It's time for bed.
Can you read us a bedtime story?
Aunty Nica's tired, sweetie. We'll let her rest now.
I'm fine.
It's important that you don't overextend yourself. Don't you think I'm the best judge of when I'm overextending myself?
Frankly, no.
Really.
I don't think you realize the strain you're under.
There's no shame in admitting that you need help. You mean "assistance."
Nica, I am worried about your heart.
Okay? Dr. Masur said I was fine, Barb.
You're at significant risk of it happening again, you know that.
13% of all T5 paraplegics...
I know the statistics.
Dr. Masur said that extreme stress, any kind of even mild shock could bring it on.
And since last night, God knows you've had plenty of both. Alice, sweetheart, please come down from there.
I'm disabled, Barb, I am not a child.
And I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. Aunty Nica, you're bleeding.
Oh, my God.
I got it. Okay?
It almost looks like a knife wound.
You must have cut yourself making dinner. I... I didn't.
Doesn't it hurt?
No. No, don't worry, sweetie.
She can't feel a thing. All right, come on.
Come on. Off to bed now.
Good night, Aunty Nica.
Good night, baby. Sweet dreams. Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I shall die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.
God bless Grandma, and Mommy, and Daddy, and Jill.
And especially Aunty Nica. What about Chucky?
He says there is no God.
Who said that?
Chucky did.
He said that life's a bitch and then you die, bleeding like a stuck pig.
Alice. You know it's not nice to curse. I don't curse, Mommy.
Chucky did. Mommy, am I going to die?
No.
Of course not, sweetie.
Grandma died.
And Chucky says we're all going to die. Alice, who really told you that?
Was it Jill?
Was it your daddy? No, it was Chucky. Okay.
Can't we sleep in with you tonight?
Alice, we've talked about this.
It's only a storm.
And Jill's going to be in in a while. Don't forget Chucky!
Don't worry, Chucky.
It's only a storm. - Ma'am, thank you for holding.
- The package... evidence depository.
Um...
I'm... I'm sorry, you're breaking up. Did you say "evidence depository"?
Hello? Hello, are you there? Chucky, I'm scared.
You fucking should be.
Oh... Sorry.
We found him.
She sure loves that thing. Yeah. She sure does.
But you know, I just called the delivery company, and they said it was sent from an evidence depository.
As in crime scene evidence?
I don't know. Maybe I heard them wrong. The connection was bad.
I'm sure that's it.
Yeah, but we still don't know who sent it.
I don't care if it was the Manson Family.
Anything that keeps her this happy is fine by me.
She's been so sad lately. I better get to bed.
Long day tomorrow.
Uh... Good night.
Good night, Jill. Andy Barclay.
Charles.
She's up.
Women.
Can't live with 'em.
Period. Shit.
What's going on?
Power's out again. I'm going to go check on Alice.
What about Jill?
What about her?
Well, come on, Barb.
You're paying her $400 a week to take care of our kid.
Don't you think she can handle it?
Ian, she's afraid of the dark. It's storming out.
She might need me.
Who, exactly, might need you? Who do you think?
Right now I'm not sure what to think.
You know...
Don't try to implicate me in your sick fantasies, okay? I've seen the way you look at her.
Ditto.
Ian, I am not sleeping with the nanny.
No, of course, you couldn't be that stupid, Barb.
Knowing that if I could prove such a thing, I could easily take Alice away from you.  Or I could just check the footage.
What are you talking about?
The footage from the nanny cam.
What nanny cam?
The one I hid in the doll today. You are not taking my daughter away from me.
Do you hear me?
I am not going to let you destroy this family because of your sick, paranoid accusations.
Oh, that's right. Tune me out.
Let Barb take care of everything.
That's what you always do anyway, right?
You latte-making loser. What's the word from Forensics?
Won't know anything for sure till they cook his blood.
Hey, you talk to anyone at St. Paul's yet?
Said he was out at the Pierce house all day.
Okay, well, maybe they'll have some answers for us.
I'm going to head out there now. Alice?
Alice!
I don't have time to play games. Barb?
Barb!
Barb, where's Alice?
Playing fucking hide and seek.
Barb, put him down. What is wrong with you?
Look, I know that this sounds nuts, but that doll,
I think that there's something in it. Wait a second. You know about this?
Well, I think that I do. You know what's in this? Do you?
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm trying to tell you. Wait, wait. When did you find out?
What does it matter? It matters to me.
It matters to me that my own sister is out to get me. No.
No, no, no, you don't understand, this...
Oh, I understand perfectly.
I understand you resent the fact that I actually have a life.
No, Barb, this isn't about anything that... Well, you know what, Nica?
It isn't my fault. Okay?
What happened to you isn't my fault.
And it isn't my fault that you dropped out of school, and it isn't my fault that you chose to never leave this goddamned house.
I mean, what the hell were you waiting for, a sign from God?
No, Barb! Just put the fucking doll down! Fuck you, Nica.
Barb!
Alice!
Get down here! Jill?
Ian!
Shit!
Alice?
Alice, don't touch anything.
You hear me? Alice, you are in big trouble, young lady!
Alice!
Alice, please.
Mommy is just about sick to death of all of you.
Alice?
Alice, you come out here right this minute.
Oh, my God.
Alice.
Alice is mine.
Now she knows there is no God.
You have your mother's eyes.
And they were always too fucking close together!
No! Barbie?
Nica.
I'm gonna get you.
Alice! Alice!
Ian!
Ian!
Ian! Ian! Ian!
Ian!
Ian! Wha... Huh?
Ian, they're dead! What are you talking about?
Barb, Jill, they're dead, and I can't find Alice? No!
No! He's still out there! Who?
Chucky!
Alice!
Alice! I gotta go find Alice.
Ian! What?
Ian, if you see Chucky, whatever you do, just leave him alone.
What are you talking about?
Just stay away from that doll! Alice?
Alice?
Ian?
Ian!
Ian!
Alice?
Ian!
Ian! No!
Nica!
No!
Nica, what the hell are you doing? He did it!
It was him! Nica!
Look at me! Give me the ax.
What? No! Now, give me the goddamn ax!
Oh, my God.
Nica, what have you done? Ian.
Ian, please. You know I would never... Oh, my God.
Ian.
Ian. Take this.
I need you to inject it under my rib. Ian.
Ian.
Ian, what are you doing?
What the hell have you done with my daughter, Nica?
Ian, where's Chucky? You're sick!
Ian, I swear to God, I can prove it!
And so can I. Hey, Barb, check this out.
RadioShack, 450 bucks.
Oh, and by the way, if you're watching this, I put it on your MasterCard.
Where are you, Alice?
They'll never find me in here, Chucky.
This is the best game of hide and seek ever.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
Chucky, stop cursing.
Say hi to the little woman for me.
Maybe not.
Your turn.
My turn.
You're Charles Lee Ray.
My friends call me Chucky.
You're dead.
No, you are.
Why us?
Didn't your mother ever mention me?
I'm an old friend of the family. Charles, come over here.
I wanna introduce you to someone.
October 27th. Okay.
Right against my rib cage.
Soon enough. Cannot come soon enough.
Charles, this is Sarah. Hi.
How do you do?
Her husband, Daniel. Hello, sir.
Hi, Daniel. Nice to meet you.
And this is Barb. She has her mother's eyes.
Such a nice, happy family.
But not for long. You like 'em?
Mmm-hmm. They're beautiful, thank you.
Difficult to find right now.
They're not exactly in season.
Anyway, enjoy.
It's gettin' late, and I'm gonna go pick up Barbie at day-care.
No!
I mean, shouldn't we have some time alone together? What about family time?
Later.
Right now I want to have you all to myself. Sarah.
Sarah, you've had me all day. It isn't enough.
That's a selfish fucking attitude for a mother to take.
You don't wanna share me with her? No.
No. Well, what's gonna happen when the baby comes?
Are you gonna keep her from me, too?
Because that would be very hurtful to me. And you wouldn't wanna see me get hurt, would you?
Would you?
Would you?
No. No.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.
I don't wanna see anybody get hurt. Okay.
I'm gonna go get Barbie.
No! Please, please! Please don't.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
You told them about us?
There is no us. Why?
Why would you want to destroy this family?
You destroyed my family. No.
I told you,
I've always had a thing for families.
No!
Especially kids. You did this to me?
No, Nica, you did this to me.
You and your mommy. She betrayed me.
Got me killed.
But I knew a way to come back.
Give me the power.
I beg of you! Took me 25 years, but believe me, it was worth the wait.
Twenty-five years.
Since then, a lot of families have come and gone.
The Barclays, the Kincaids, the Tillys, but Nica, your family was always my favorite.
And now, you're the last one standing. So to speak.
You know, you remind me a lot of Andy Barclay.
He was a whiny little bitch, just like you.
Did you kill him, too?
More or less.
I killed his childhood.
And the truth is, I killed you 25 years ago. Didn't I, Nica?
You haven't been living.
You can't call this living.
You've just been on life support. Time to pull the fucking plug.
So you never actually killed Andy Barclay, did you?
What?
You know, it's called completion anxiety.
It's very common in males.
You are a male, aren't you? Oh...
I'm gonna kill you slow. Yeah, no, I get that.
Twenty-five years. Must be the slowest murder in history. I mean, what are you waiting for?
A sign from God? No!
You feel that, don't ya?
You wanna play, motherfucker?
Let's play. Police.
Open up.
Help! Help me! Based on the evidence, the defendant is declared legally incompetent and remanded indefinitely to a facility for the criminally insane.
I'm alive, you son of a bitch.
You hear me?
I'm still alive! I'm still alive!
Please leave a message.
Hey, it's me.
I'm on my way. And don't forget my money. They never learn.
So who's next?
Next.
Good afternoon.
Three-day, two-day, or overnight?
Overnight. It's extremely urgent.
Fragile? Surprisingly not.
Approximate value?
Well, my mother always used to say you can't put a price on love.
Under 250, then.
Would you like to insure the package?
Oh, that won't be necessary.
It protects you and it protects the recipient.
I doubt that.
Perishable goods? Live animal?
Just put "other." Grandma, I'm home.
Grandma?
And how are you today? Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Chucky, you found me!
I told you I would. Where's Grandma?
In the cellar.
What's she doing down there?
Nothin'.
Chucky, Mommy and Daddy are dead.
Aunty Nica killed them.
But I'm your friend till the end, Alice.
And now it's time to play.
Hide and seek?
Hide the soul.
And guess what? You're it.
Why do I always have to be it?
Because you're somebody that no one would ever suspect.
Now, close your eyes. Give me the power, I beg of you.
Package for you.
Really? Maybe you won something.
Must be my lucky day.
Have a good one.
Thanks. You, too. Oh, boy.
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom, how you doing? I'm sorry I didn't call.
I meant to.
Yeah, I'm definitely coming for my birthday tomorrow.
No, don't get me anything.
Do me a favor, Ma, no surprises, okay? Yeah.
I'll be there, like, noon? 1:00?
What are you making for dinner? Yeah?
How's Mike doing?
Well, tell him I said hello.
Um...
Yeah. All right.
Come on, open up, open up!
Well, I'll see you around that time. Okay.
Yeah. Aha!  Play with this.
Andy...
You think you've had Ah a bad day at work?
I think I got you beaten. Nope.
That's my partner.
Suck it!
There I am.
Three or four days ago, I didn't know this world existed. Three or four days ago, I wasn't in the Rest In Peace Department.
I heard you coming by the way.
Look at this French girl gets the job from Boston's finest.
Hey, you got the drop on me huh?
I feel like a genius right now. I couldn't have planned this better.
Well, genius there is an orange tree in the backyard. I like it there.
Yeah, there is an orange tree in the backyard.
How weird. I don't know how it get here.
Me neither.
You know it's a similar prosperity, don't you?
I've never heard that. It is.
Ask anyone for it. No. You're crazy.
This tree is never gonna make it through the winter.
Well, we aren't gonna make it through the winter.
In this freezing little house.
I love our freezing little house.
But don't you want more? I always worried about money.
Don't you want to real a house, a car? I don't worry about money, You do.
I have everything I need right here.
My husband with me.
Well, you will always have that. I got to go to work.
I'll tell you when you can go to work.
Oh, really? Watch that ankle.
Love you, baby! Bye. Love you!
I got my picture in the trophy case I see.
Look at that!
Already immortalized. Oh, right place, right time.
What can I say? Hey, Bobby.
Hey. Garth, Jesus, get a rope or something.
You're asking too much of that towel.
Morning, partner. Good morning.
Hey guys, love to have you at the Union, maybe, Monday. Oh sweet Jesus, Murphy.
Come on! Oh no! I will shoot that thing.
That's pretty devastating.
It's gonna be awhile before I get that image out. Hey, what did you do with yours?
I burried it.
Really?
I thought you'll be joking about that. You know it's not the worst idea.
It's gold and you buried it.
Right? Listen, Bobby.
I'm out.
You're out?
Nothing has to change for you.
You do whatever you want. But I'm putting mine in the evidence.
It's done. Nicky.
I said I will move it first. I'll take care of everything.
It's not what I'm talking about Bobby.
I'm talking about the way she looked at me this morning.
I knew.
We went in there to make a drug bust.
Which we did.
We didn't expect this gold to fall through our laps.
We weren't looking for it. But then it happened.
The way I see it.
You do it for Julia. For your future together.
It's simple. No.
She's happy. I'm not going to risk that.
I'm sorry buddy. Oh, you're right.
I hate it when you're right.
We got to turn the whole thing in.
There goes the speedboat.
Look, you don't have to worry.
I'm not biting my fingers at you.
You do whaever you want to do. No.
It's bothering me too.
So, let's grow old and poor together.
Listen up! We got Garza.
We got an address. Wait, you got Garza?
You got an actual eyes on him?
An informant gave up this whole meth operation.
He's there we got him.
Okay, We're in business, partner.
Get another picture in the trophy case. Do you know how long we've been waiting for Garza to slip up?
The guy is a Meth dealer, a cop killer.
He's got 30 guys with them. It's not gonna go easy.
Now, standby for inspiring motivating words from Detective Bobby Hayes.
How about we don't get shot today.
That's great advice here. You're good cop.
Detective Hayes advice us we should avoid getting shot.
And also everybody should put their charm braclets on now. Hey, that's my grandmother's St.
Christopher Medal, jackass.
It's adorable.
I wear for protection.
As for protection, well this stop bullets.
And yours is stops you from getting dates. Let's go!
Move it! Move in! Let's go!
Stay on my lead. Let's put them on their heals.
Hey, Be safe will ya? Knock.
Knock.
Police Officer!
I see Garza. He's on the catwalk.
Damn it!
Garza out the South window. Jesus!
Wow that was close.
The hell you're doing?
You almost got me.
Bud, I can't let you turn that gold in. What?
Tuff day.
It's a little old to be in a tounge tied at first.
I want you to know that I'm here to help you. I've sat in that chair.
So take your time.
Ease in to it. Ease in to what?
Come on genius.
I know you can get there. This is a joke.
Halarious. Hahaha.
I'm dead?
Let's be honest. Being a dirty cop.
Is one of the highest shot in the face percentage jobs.
That's not who I am. Really? Pretty boy?
How'd it feel as you were headed towards judgment?
Comfortable?
Feel like you're bound for glory?
Or you're a little worried that you're going down.
I thought so.
You're lucky Nick.
You have skills that we want.
So, we're giving you a choice.
You can take your chances with judgment.
Or you can join the R.I.P.D. The R.I.P.D?
Rest In Peace Department.
I get it. It's cute.
Simply put, we find dead people that have manage to escape judgment.
We ship them off back down to where they belong.
Tour is 100 years.
You say yes we send you back down to Boston.
Your home turf.
I'll do it.
That's not gonna work.
What's not going to work? I said I'm in.
I know what you're thinking.
You're in a rush. You want your life back.
You want Julia. No. You asked me to help you.
You really don't think I can read you? I know everything there is to know about you.
Don't ponder on this opportunity, Nick.
I know for a fact.
You can use a good recommendation on Judgement Day, okay?
I think you're smelling what I'm selling.
Any more questions?
What's with this Steely Dan? No idea.
It's always playing.
Seems to relax people. Let's do this.
Yes Lax. This will tickle abit.
What the fuck?
Why don't you jump in and get over here? Settle down!
This is holding we call them Dead'O.
Until they popped they look like regular people.
So, no one except us knows they're monsters inside.
Hey!
You see if you slipped through the cracks, and stand right there if you die,
Your souls rots.
They rot.
The world rots. Global warming, Black plaque, Bad cell receptions. Get it?
Without the R.I.P.D, the world would have been overrun by these dead people.
Sometime in 1954.
I'll stay. No option.
150,000 people die everyday.
This place is, wasn't design to handle that kind of volume. Welcome to the big league.
R.I.P.D. Boston.
Before you are the greatest law officers, who ever lived and died.
With the 3rd biggest precinct in the force.
What's the first? Bocca.
R.I.P.D. Scottsdale a lot of volume too.
Trust me, Chase here is making a big come back. I'm telling you!
Chicks dig it.
It's a lot to take in on your first day dead.
But don't worry, your partner will explain it all to you.
No!

Almost had him. Come on!
Roy!
Oh you come on!
'Cause I'm the only one willing to leave the love.
Oh Jesus. Oh you Jesus!

Would you like to take this up to the Eternal Affairs?
We both know what this is about, don't we, honeypon?
Not the time, Roy.
Why not have it out now? I'm comfortable. Roy, meet your new partner.
Nick Walker.
We've been over this before. I'm a one man operation.
Had a choice Roy? Nope.
You got to earn that.
Come on, Rookie.
Grab your. Hop on in, don't be shy.
Ever think about hiding this place a little better?
When was the last time you got a VCR repaired? Point taken.

We'll gonna be late.
PROCTOR to start job for some closure.
Come in!
Disappointing turn out, huh?
Expected more? We got a lot to talk about.

This moment is not about me.
This is about you. Letting go.
Thank you for letting me soaked it in.
I'll wait for you.
Alright.
You know what my funeral was?
Of some a bunch of coyote's, picked my carcas clean, and dragged my bones off into a cave.
Freaking cave of. Here it comes.
Becareful now!
Hey! Come on! Watch it!
Julia! Julia!

I'm sorry but I don't know you.
Can we just talk or we'd just go somewhere?
Julia!
Hey Julia! What's your problem?
Huh? Piece of shit!
Piece of shit!
Back on the meth's place.
That went well.
I knew something is asked for you.
What just happened?
How could she not know it's me?
To them, you don't look like you, you don't sound like you.
If you try to tell them who you are comes out all garbled out.
The Universe and it's ultimate wisdom, would not let you revealed yourself.
It's smarter than us.
That's sick.
Consider it The Universe Witness Protection program.
So what do I look like?
Here. These are your ID's.
Some federals, lot of utilities.
Whatever get us access. Really?
An old Chinese guy? What about you?
Like I see you win Roy. Let me bring you up to speed with what's on my plate.
When you ride with me, You ride with the best.
Pace as lightning, Expectation high.
Things are gonna come at you fast. They gonna come hard. They gonna come wet.
Learn to drive Bimbo!
You've done this before?
Ah! You're gonna get your feet wet, with the standard pickup.
Found the suspect, Test 'em. See if these a Dead'O. And then...
Look at the ankles on that girl. That's what you're into.
Ankles? That's what does it for you?
In my days women dress up in certainty.
That makes you real ass creepy.
When exactly was your day?
1800 buddy.
I'm what we used to call a lawman.
Marshall Roycephus Pulsifer.
Roycephus? It's considered a very sexy name at that time.
Sounds like an S.T.D. [Sexual Transmitted Disease] Would you care to drive?
I didn't get a peek at your wife's ankle.
Not one more word about her.
Listen Rook, You better work on getting a little distance.
Because you too are over.
You just worry about yourself partner. Woah, you ain't my partner Rook.
You're just the ass on that other seat till I say contrary.
I had a partner. Greatest man I'd ever knew.
Not up until he shot me in the back.
This is what partners will get to.
Tell me about it.
How do you think I got here? You got shot with a modern bullet.
I would have liked a modern bullet. Sanitary glazed.
That's exactly how it felt as passed through my face. Sanitary.
The term partner died when I did.
You got it Roycephus. Roycephus!
Cephus. Just call me Roy.  I was going to do that.
Roycephus. Listen up!
This is tactical Rook.
Tactical? A bag of Indian food.
Yup.
Got a tip on a possible Dead'O in this building.
Now listen and learn. Dead'O.
Full of awful bad dead Mojo. Effect everything with their soul stacked.
Effect everything for the worse.
People and things. There you go.
Broken shits is a dead give away. Soul killers.
Hit a Dead'O in the head with one of this.
And it's got to be the head.
First half on the face most rectified.
You're raised from the cosmos.
All the life ones would hurt us, see be extra careful where you point that thing.
You saw my gun ain't on safety.
It. Ankle piece is strappin'.
Like world gun don't do deadly squats here.
You keep your eyes off my ankles. Thank you. This out.
Even more promising.
It's always the quiet one.
You ready? You pumped?
Need you out here. Get your snowman on. Get frosty.
I'd say hot. Is this you try to sound like a cop?
This throws up a lot of red flags for me.
Got to learn the lingo umbrido.
I'm frosty. Don't worry about it.
Senior Officer gets to knock Rook.
I've got 15 years in the force knock off the Rookie bullshit. Oh, you've done this before.
You know what's waiting for you behind the door.
You can take your 15 years and you can throw it down the toilet. Because this, ain't that.
I'll knock you do the cards. Stanley Nawicky, We're with the Department Of Health.
Is there a problem?
Oh, nothing Narwicky. We suspect that you might be dead.
Is this really necassary?
No offense but, you sounds kindda crazy.
Point taken. It's just a routine test. By your hair.
I am not dead.
I meant that's laugh but check my pulse go ahead.
Rook, first question.
It's late on ash Wednesday an Asian teenager in slumdog Acura.
Do you accept? How am I supposed to answer that?
Oh you tell me.
Okay, the answer is no.
What's the problem? Is it the teenager? Yes?
Is it the Japanese performance to dance? Perhaps means the Indian food.
Maybe he hates Indian.
No. That's a...
Card.
The teenager is Armenian.
The day is Rosh Hashanah. The dish is SAAG PANEER.  I don't want it.
Why not?
Is it spicy? Too mushy? You.
You can't eat during an interview. I... I don't want anyone.
You don't what?
Card!
The car is a lime green Scion.
The season is the solstice. The dish is CHlCKEN TlKKA MASALA.
No!
Yes.
Yes it is! It's Chicken Tikka!
It's Chicken Tikka! Oh yeah!
That's a Dead'O.
Big O' mouth coming in.
Snitch in life.
Seen him like that.
Metaphorical.
For some reasons Indian foods seems to do the trick.
Maybe it's the Kuma.
You can bag this one. My treat. No!
Im not going anywhere near that.
Where is that 15 years now frosty?
Gotta get comfortable with the visual in the smell profile. Alright, spread them.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry up. Let's get this over with.
That won't be a problem when all is over.
Spread pal. Put all your hands behind your back.  Stupid space cuffs.
Hey!
No! You want it?
You got it!
Here! Grab him!
Get the rest of him!
Oh shit!
Where he's at?
Pun head! Relax your body!
What?
Relax money! Give me a reason.
Time to find for me a good one.
Had to make me give him a chance.
Might have notice we're pretty durable.
It still hurts! That's what works the bottom.
Bottom?
Okay. That's mostly understable. You'd really gonna run it through that?
Brief after action report.
Now, we blow within the room. But you did respond well to my steering during the airbone portion.
Your internal organs provided me a very soft landing.
You have a very impressive crumples up.
With the exception of letting yourself get attached directly to the.
Stop talking. You were solid.
C plus.
Stop talking. Stop it! Stop it!
Stop talking! You're the one who's talking.
You ran your mouth at my funeral.
You ran your mouth when you pushed me out of the building.
You run your mouth non-stop since the minute we met.
No! No! No!
Shut up. Shut up and let me deal.
Oh! You deal! You deal with the up Chuck.
Come to think of it. With all this tantruming.
I'm begining to think that im a little too generous from a plus from that C.
I'm just to lower your grade. Relax body.
My hat!
My hat!
My hat! You brave.
F.
Bus I can forgive. My hat.
Can't even talk about that now.
Go! Go! Go!
Let's go. The hell is this? A fire drill?
Never seen anything this busy. Seems like every Dead'O to Boston last week.
What did I say? Get back out there. No breaks for everyone till the surge is under control.
If I didn't need you back on the streets...
What? You have my ass? Dont be a clich'e.
You let them get at the window. Aren't you better than them?
You're the one who put me with the training wheels here.
Be gone. Make yourself being boss.
Still large on the boss part.
Don't you? That's the game That's what you wanted.
I don't play the game.
And my ass is mine and mine alone!
Ignorant!
Come on! Glad anyway. Roy!
Narwicky was trying awfully hard to protect this gold.
Don't you think we should try to figure out what it is?
Trust me it's nothing. The man in that these things. Is just fundraising at 'em from various religions.
Just crap!
What about the one percent?
That's why we locked 'em up in here.
Bag it. Tag it and burried deep.
Is that all of it?
That's it. Sign here please.  Roy!
Listen.
What? Narwicky cared an awful lot about that gold.
Yeah.
He was trying to hide it from us.
Why? So now you're gung-ho huh?
I'm... I'm thinking we should follow up.
Let me guess, Genius has a plan.
Genius wants to get off the street and work this.
I think you could help me with that. You know why?
Because every great cop that I've ever known.
Has their own informant.
Big Roy! I meant Big Roy ain't gotta have one. You want an informant?
Big Roy got the best informant.
Red socks. Number 34. Damn!
Eliot! You're pain in the ass Dead'O.
All he cares about is the socks.
So, I'll let him stick around in exchange for information.
Here!
You're in mourning.
Got a hole to fill.
You know, I can't taste anything.
Of course not! You're dead.
R.I.P.D. don't eat we don't sleep.
We're here to kick Dead'O ass. That's about it.
Then why would you eat this? I enjoyed the mouth feel. How's it going Eliot?
We're up.
But the hitline crap.
We'll blow it. Knock yourself out.
Hello Eliot.
One of your buddies, well gets erased for this.
Rook...
That belongs to the evidence.
I thought you were some kind of rebel Roy?
I fought for the more. Would you mind terribly.
If I got back to my investigations?
Go continue your investigations. Tell me what this is Eliot.
That looks like a big hunk of gold.
Hahaha. It's not gonna cut it try again.
Hey! Hey! Get your hands off me.
You behave yourself now Eliot.
'Cause of me you're sitting there all cozy in that land in the pun box. Not opening a desert trying to get your fingers back from the coyote.
You cops are all the same.
Always obssesed in about how you bid it.
How was your funeral newbie? Did you cry?
Well they gave your wife that nice folded up flag. Haha. Hey!
That's fun right?
I think we both know there is no red socks on either sides. So why don't you co-operate?
I apologize for my poor attitude.
May I take a closer look Sir?
You may. Yeah well look, I'm sorry to disappoint but this is crap.
Look, Dead'O they're sentimental.
Lots of them believe in this talismatic junk.
For something else there be some chatter out there.
I would know.
Alright. We're done here.
These hats are crap.
Keep your heads up and inform me.
Yes Sir. You gave him the gold?
He seems squirm. We got him.
Got him? What do you meant we got him? What we get?
Tell you what he got. He got the gold. Which you gave him.
What the hell is the matter with you?
I'm pissed about my hat.
There, looky looky.
I'm gonna teach you modern law enforcement.
This is called giving the dog a bone.
Bones?
What he's doing?
Okay. That's weird.
'Cause that looks exactly like your ex-partner. The one who shot you dead.  Okay.
I'm interested. Caller me interested. He might be chasing you huh?
First the guy smoking like a knuck worse.
Now we got guys just handing him gold. Let me think. Just let me think.
What's there to think about?
The man just screwing you from left to right.
Your own partner. And the trifecta.
Sleeping with your wife.
'Cause this is your house isn't it?
Total humiliation.
Just don't pass down in the supermarket. He's not sleeping with Julia.
Wanna bet? Yeah let's...
Winner shoots the loser in the face as many time as he wants.
Not a hundred percent confident winning the read.
Something always from Mike's.
Seeing how Nick's used to make us stop and getting for it. Thank you.
Thank you Bobby.
Hey Julia.
Nick seems alright to you?
Isn't he concerned about anything? No.
Okay. Okay. Why?
I'm sorry I got to do this now.
Nick said he burried something.
If he's not sleeping with her, It's kindda funny he's here isn't it?
Unless you got is half a pack scrubbing for porn of your laptop for you. I get that.  Classic actually.
He gave this to me.
He knew I wanted it. What are you saying?
That he just did this to hide something under it? I don't know.
But I got to take a look. I was hoping I was wrong.
Just he stole this?
Oh God I feel sick.
You crook son of a bitch. When were you going to tell me about this?
Put the gun down.
Shut up. Just get it away from me. I don't want to see it.
Don't worry. Don't worry about a thing.
He was my best friend. I don't even knew who he was.
Get off from me or I break your legs.
Explanation now. We spli...
We took something.
From a bunch of shit rats who would have turned into guns or drugs or who knows what. It was a victim of crime.
End of story.
Why would the Dead'O want it?
You think and I know about this Dead'O shit?
It was just money that me, I was trying to make our lives better.
Alright you did a good job of that didn't ya?
Why don't you go and try thing again.
Explain it to her, that went well. Try it again.
If it makes you... Gold's getting away.
Come on.
Tighten it up.
My wife sees me as a piece of shit.
Actually she sees you as an old Chinese guy.
By the way granpa Chin pretty solid look. Help you stay stakeouts.  The only thing I ever cared about is what she thought of me.
Is all that matters.
The only thing which she thinks...
That's who I am. I blew that.
Destroyed it.
Boo hoo. You heard me, Boody hoo.
You might be the worst person I've ever met.
Sadly, you do not get to tell her how you did it all for her.
And where exactly do you think you tragedy ranks on the scales cosmic of injustice?
Pakistan earthquake level?
Killing tiers level? To me it was pretty big.
You're playing you're the only who was cut down in his prime?
You think I felt unresolved as my as my face was being devowed by a.
Oh Christ.
You just gonna have to learn to sit on your regret and pain. And turned the things to adult persistence.
The way I do it.
The way im handles it. I do music videos my phone numbers is on the back.
Excuse me,
Im not a piece of meat put on this earth for your gratification.
I'm a woman.
Respect me or I'll castrate you like a three year old stair. Look sharp.
We got something. Oh yeah.
That's a Dead'O.
That has got to be his friends. You stay on the gold.
I got it. Hold up.
That is on point. No thanks. Let's see you in action.
You questioning my methods? You ever have a method? Excuse me Sir, but word.
Freezer.
Allow me.
My bad. Let me guess, R.I.P.D. Huh?
Great looks man.
You and your spadex expresso and... Easy with the razor.
You with your magnificent breast.
Watch it.
Hey sideburns, tell us about the gold.
Look, we're friends here.
Help each other out.
You don't wanna get pop. I don't want to popped here. Oh you don't?
No.
As soon as you give us that case. You got to start talking and you keep to be roaming around.
With your bitch and ginger sideburns. You know what...
I'm sick of hiding.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hell yeah.
Let's do this.
Suck it!
Straight butt!
Come on! Lower your pants.
Have some butt roping to do. Okay.
Are you okay? Somebody call 911.
I'm okay. Nothing to see. Got to go.
Idiot! Aim for the head! Hell yeah.
You son of a bitch. Aw, my ass.
What is that?
Relax body.
Rook!
Over here!
If not too much trouble. Thank you very much.
I've never seen one like that before.
Never. Never before has this happen.
Congratulations guys on your unprecedented cock-up.
You let an exposed Dead'O loose on the street. In the middle of the day.
You're supposed to contain.
That is your most basic job you failed spectacularly to contain.
All right pretty five was different.
We have evidence.
As on of their bunch of... Don't get creative.
You do as you're told.
When you don't this happens.
Terrifying whatever rampage through the streets of Boston today was not human.
Now look where we are.
You get to deal with them.
Who in this endless streams of freaks is them?
Eternal Affairs. Hammers dropping. Well?
They're pissed.
Justify apparently stumbled across something important.
Don't act too surprised onr it boss.
The gold that Officers Pulsifer and Walker brought in are part of an incredibly dangerous artifact known as the Staff of Jericho. Oh, crap!
Maybe feather in for the new guy?
A little bit?
Remember the tunnel we pull you out of when you died?
That's the only way to get to the afterlife.
One way street.
This artifact if build, reverses the tunnel.
The dead reign down on this earth, That's it for the living world.
Massive destruction we broke into pieces 3000 years ago.
Now it's back.
Till we got the rest of the gold, we're on red alert.
Also apparently you need the blood of enemy.
There are more diagrams. Why?  Why?
Why would someone make something like that?
Come on!
Here I am willing the streets into order...
Making headway... Year after dominant year.
And now everything I've done is being threatened because of some ancient for kids by some asshole 5000 years ago?
Why even try? How am I supposed to do it? Look Jesus, You're proud of yourself.
I got an important too.
What? Well...
What is it? Actually...
It looks like, you two don't need to concern yourself with the red alert.
It brings me no pleasure. To inform you because of your recent epic failure,
You both been suspended you're off the case.
Hold on a second. We are the case.
We're the ones who brought it in.
I'm feeling that was involved there would be a formal hearing tomorrow after which you're most likely to be erased.
Erased?
In this moment of clashes. They're going to suspend and then erase their best Officer?
And this other guy.
Better Officers are taking over.
No such thing name one.
Jacobson, Dubo, Watterson, Carson, Jackson.
Pretty good. That guy who works at the taco card. Shall I go on?
Okay Okay! So tomorrow is my last day...
Most likely.
I'm sorry. Well, it's a shame.
Miss Proctor it's been a delight.
Roy, Thank you very much for your mentorship I'm sure it meant a lot to you.
I got somewhere more important to be. Who are you?
Why are you following me huh?
Stay away from me.
I haven't left you.
It's me.
No...
Rook... Congratulations, you finally did it.
You get what you wanted.
I might get erased tomorrow what do you think im going to do?
You're freaking her out if you haven't noticed.
I'm not the time motion level. And yes in my day I bought my love by the hour.
But I do know, what you're doing is not helping.
Causing her pain.
Why do you think we're here?
What we do what we do.
It's so that Julia can have the a world to live in.
And yeah and that maybe that's you.
She need to survive this. Meet someone new.
Maybe have a family.
Because you are not coming back.
Ever!
The job is all you have now. But we don't have the job anymore.
Nick, your crap.
You're like me. Like you?
Yes and you're like my piece. I'll come.
Hey fucking me for a long time won't achive this state.
You can get there too but for your weakness.
I've had it.
I can't listen to one more self righteous chesnut out of your mouth.
I don't want to live in your weird past with you.
Speak which, those coyote's making ball crap out of your face.
In that story the coyote's are the heroes.
Hey you may think.
It wasn't.
It was smelly. It was violent. It was written with no count engines I've had a lot of anger.
To get past.
Okay?
And you, you need to bring a lot of shit out to have been suppressing.
For very long time. One of the Coyote make love to my skull.
Do you know what that practice coming to call?
I do.
And I certainly hope you got both eyes Roy.
Song is called better man.
Maybe I took things a little too far.
Maybe.
I'm sorry.
You ought take too much Nick. Spent with.
Maybe your last moments. You're right about the job Roy.
We got to get back out there.
They want me back they gonna have to beg.

You wanna help me stop the you know an apocalypse.
You put a bad Roy. Hell yeah Kind of beg me into a corner.
I know his that gold.
There is no way he's just a bagman.
Let me ask you something.
Did he like Indian food?
He's not a fan. But something is bugging me.
I rode this guy for 5 years.

Artifact that could masked it.
Like a spiritual deodorant.
Or something he carries with him all the time.
Like grandma sacress for metal?
That. Let's go pop this son of a bitch.
You know what to do?
Oh yeah. Waiting a long time for this. You wait a long time?
You know how many years Dead'O have been trying to pull this off?
Not one of those could get all that gold together.
Until me.
R.I.P.D is not going to know what him 'em.
Now go find yourself some trouble. My pleasure. Hey Julia.
Hey, I need to talk to you about something really strange happened to me.

Reasonably.
